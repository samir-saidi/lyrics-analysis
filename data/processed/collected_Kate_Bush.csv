Kate Bush,Wuthering Heights,The Single File (1978 - 1983),"Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy

Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master

Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering

Oh, what a waste of army dreamers

Tears over a tin box
Oh, Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know
Like a chicken with a fox
He couldn't win the war with ego
Give the kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have buttons and bows

Babooshka

She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worst move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter

""All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya""

Babooshka

She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go
To see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out

""I'm all yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya

Kate Bush,Cloudbusting,Hounds of Love,"I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo that glowed in the dark
What made it special made it dangerous
So I bury it and forget

But every time it rains you're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small in their big black car
To be a threat to the men in the power

I hid my yo-yo in the garden
I can't hide you from the government
Oh, God, Daddy, I won't forget

'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen


And every time it rains
You're here in my head

When I was a child, running in the night

Oh, here I go
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I'll be
Two steps on the water

I found a fox caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
And I'm ashamed of running away
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this
I'm still afraid to be there

(Do, do-do, do, do)

There's something appears in the way – it's a plank in me eye
With a camel who's trying to get through it
Am I doing it? Can I have it all now?
I want it all
I pull out the plank and say, “Thank you for yanking me
Back to the fact that there's always something to distract
But sometimes it's hard to know if I'm doing it right”

Kate Bush,Watching You Without Me,Hounds of Love,"You can't hear me
You can't hear me
You can't hear what I'm saying
You can't hear what I'm saying to you

You watch the clock move the slow hand
I should have been home hours ago
But I'm not here
But I'm not here

You can't hear me
You can't hear me
You can't feel me
Here in the room with you now
You can't hear what I'm saying
You don't hear what I'm saying to you

Can't let you know what's been happening
There's a ghost in our home just watching you without me
But I'm not here
But I'm not here
But I'm not here

You don't hear me
You don't hear me

Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
We, we see
We see, we, we see, we, we see
We see, we, we see, we, we see
We, we see

You didn't hear me come in
Help me, baby, help me, baby, talk to me
Listen to me, baby
Listen to me, listen to me, talk to me, oh, please, listen
You can't hear me
Listen, baby, listen to me, baby, help me, help me, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, please, baby, talk to me
You won't hear me leaving",236
Kate Bush,The Dreaming,The Single File (1978 - 1983),"“Bang” goes another kanga on the bonnet of the van
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
Many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree
Till you near him on the motorway and the tree begin to breathe
See the light ram through the gaps in the land

Coming in with the golden light
In the morning
Coming in with the golden light
Is the New Man
Coming in with the golden light
Is my dented van

The civilised keep alive the territorial war
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
Erase the race that claim the place and say we dig for Ore
Or dangle Devils in a bottle and push them from the Pull of the Bush
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
You find them in the road
See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand
In the road

Coming in with the golden light
In the morning
Coming in with the golden light
With no warning
Coming in with the golden light
We bring in the rigging
Dig, dig, dig, dig away

Kate Bush,The Big Sky,Hounds of Love,"They look down
At the ground
Missing
But I never go in now

I'm looking at the big sky
I'm looking at the big sky now
I'm looking at the big sky
You never understood me
You never really tried

That cloud, that cloud
It looks like Ireland
C'mon and blow it a kiss now
But quick!

'Cause it's changing in the big sky
It's changing in the big sky now
We're looking at the big sky
You never understood me
You never really tried

Come on, build me an Ark
And if you're coming, jump

Kate Bush,The Morning Fog,Hounds of Love,"The light
Begin to bleed
Begin to breathe
Begin to speak
Do you know what?
I love you better now

I am falling
Like a stone
Like a storm
Being born again
Into the sweet morning fog

Do you know what?
I love you better now

I'm falling
And I'd love to hold you now
I'll kiss the ground
I'll tell my mother
I'll tell my father
I'll tell my loved ones
I'll tell my brothers
How much I love them",81
Kate Bush,The Man with the Child in His Eyes,The Single File (1978 - 1983),"I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realize he's there when I turn the light off
And turn over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon

And suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love, till eternity

Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes

He's very understanding
He's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late he's always waiting
But I feel him hesitate
Oh, I'm so worried about my love
They say, “No, no, it won't last forever”

And here I am again, my girl
Wondering what on Earth I'm doing here
Maybe he doesn't love me
I just took a trip on my love for him

Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes",179
