Kate Bush,Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God),Hounds of Love,"It doesn't hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna feel how it feels? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm makin'? (Yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be runnin' up that road
Be runnin' up that hill
Be runnin' up that buildin'
Say, if I only could, ooh-ooh

You don't wanna hurt me (Yeah, yeah, yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Unaware, I'm tearin' you asunder (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Yeah, yeah, yo)
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Yeah, yeah, yo)

You
It's you and me
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy

Kate Bush,Wuthering Heights,The Single File (1978 - 1983),"Out on the wily, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you, I loved you too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master

Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
Ooh, let me have it
Let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy

Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window
Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
I've come home, I'm so cold

Our little army boy
Is coming home from B.F.P.O
We've a bunch of purple flowers
To decorate a mammy's hero
Mourning in the aerodrome
The weather warmer, he is colder
Four men in uniform
To carry home my little soldier

(What could he do? Should have been a
 rock star)
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
(
What could he do? 
Should have
 been a politician
)
But he never had a proper education
(What could he do? Should have been a father)
But he never even made it to his twenties
What a waste, army dreamers
Oh, what a waste of army dreamers

Tears over a tin box
Oh, Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know
Like a chicken with a fox
He couldn't win the war with ego
Give the kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have buttons and bows

Babooshka

She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worst move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter

""All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya""

Babooshka

She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go
To see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when she was beautiful
He shouted out

""I'm all yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours
Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya
All yours

Kate Bush,Cloudbusting,Hounds of Love,"I still dream of Orgonon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo that glowed in the dark
What made it special made it dangerous
So I bury it and forget

But every time it rains you're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

On top of the world, looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked too small in their big black car
To be a threat to the men in the power

I hid my yo-yo in the garden
I can't hide you from the government
Oh, God, Daddy, I won't forget

'Cause every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is gonna happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen


And every time it rains
You're here in my head
Like the Sun coming out
Look, your son's coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen
I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen, oh
Ooh, just saying it could even make it happen

Yeah, yeah, yay-yo
“We're cloudbusting, daddy”

Kate Bush,This Woman’s Work,The Sensual World,"Pray God you can cope
I stand outside this woman's work
This woman's world
Ooh, it's hard on the man
Now his part is over
Now starts the craft of the father

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying, but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping, but I can't stop thinking
Of all the things I should've said
That I never said
All the things we should've done
That we never did
All the things I should've given
But I didn't
Oh, darling, make it go
Make it go away

Give me these moments back
Give them back to me
Give me that little kiss
Give me your hand

I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left
I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a lot of strength left

Kate Bush,Hounds of Love,Hounds of Love,"It's in the trees, it's coming!

When I was a child, running in the night
Afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark, hiding in the street
And of what was following me

(Do-do, do-do, do, do)
Now hounds of love are hunting
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've always been a coward
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I don't know what's good for me

Oh, here I go
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, someone, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I'll be
Two steps on the water

I found a fox caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
And I'm ashamed of running away
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this
I'm still afraid to be there

(Do, do-do, do, do)
Among your hounds of love
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I feel your arms surround me
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've always been a coward
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
And never know what's good for me

Oh, here I go, don't let me go
Hold me down
It's coming for me through the trees
Oh, help me, darling, help me, please
Take my shoes off and throw them in the lake
And I'll be two steps on the water
(Do, do-do, do, do)

I don't know what's good for me
I don't know what's good for me
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
Yeah-yo, yeah-yo, your love

Do you know what I really need?
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah",291

Kate Bush,Suspended in Gaffa,The Dreaming,"Out in the garden, there's half of a heaven
And we're only bluffing – we're not ones for busting through walls
But they've told us unless we can prove that
We're doing it, we can't have it all
I want it all
He's gonna wangle a way to get out of it
She's an excuse and a witness who'll talk when he's called
But they've told us unless we can prove that
We're doing it, we can't have it all
I want it all, I want it all
We can't have it all
I want it all

“I caught a glimpse of God, all shining and bright…”

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not until I'm ready for you
Not until I'm ready for you
Can I have it all?

I try to get nearer, but as it gets clearer
There's something appears in the way – it's a plank in me eye
With a camel who's trying to get through it
Am I doing it? Can I have it all now?
I want it all
I pull out the plank and say, “Thank you for yanking me
Back to the fact that there's always something to distract
But sometimes it's hard to know if I'm doing it right”
Can I have it all now?
I want it all
Can I have it all now?
I want it all
Can I have it all?
I want it all
I can't have it all

“We all have a dream… maybe”

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not until I'm ready for you
Not until I'm ready for you
Can I have it all?

I won't open boxes that I am told not to
I'm not a Pandora, I'm much more like
That girl in the mirror between you and me
She don't stand a chance of getting anywhere at all
I want it all
Not anywhere at all
I want it all
No, not a thing
I want it all
She can't have it all

“Mother, where are the angels? I'm scared of the changes”

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in Gaffa?
Not until I'm ready for you
Not until I'm ready for you
Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
