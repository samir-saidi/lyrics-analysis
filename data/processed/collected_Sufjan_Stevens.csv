Sufjan Stevens,Fourth of July,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"The evil, it spread like a fever ahead
It was night when you died, my firefly
What could I have said to raise you from the dead?
Oh, could I be the sky on the Fourth of July?

""Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply

""Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles""

The hospital asked, ""Should the body be cast?""
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?

""Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light
Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""

We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die
We're all gonna die",253
Sufjan Stevens,Mystery of Love,Mystery of Love,"Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love

Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me

How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed?
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath

Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love",192
Sufjan Stevens,Should Have Known Better,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"I should have known better
To see what I could see
My black shroud
Holding down my feelings
A pillar for my enemies
I should have wrote a letter
And grieve what I happen to grieve
My black shroud
I never trust my feelings
I waited for the remedy
When I was three, three, maybe four
She left us at that video store
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I’m light as a feather
I’m bright as the Oregon breeze
My black shroud
Frightened by my feelings
I only wanna be a relief
No, I’m not a go-getter
The demon had a spell on me
My black shroud
Captain of my feelings
The only thing I wanna believe
When I was three, and free to explore
I saw her face on the back of the door
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
Oh, be my rest, be my fantasy
I should have known better
Nothing can be changed
The past is still the past
The bridge to nowhere
I should have wrote a letter
Explaining what I feel, that empty feeling
Don’t back down, concentrate on seeing
The breakers in the bar, the neighbor’s greeting
My brother had a daughter
The beauty that she brings, illumination
Don’t back down, there is nothing left
The breakers in the bar, no reason to live
I’m a fool in the fetter (fool in the fetter)
Rose of Aaron’s beard, where you can reach me
Don’t back down: nothing can be changed
Cantilever bridge, the drunken sailor
My brother had a daughter (brother had a daughter)
The beauty that she brings, illumination (illumination)
Illumination",279
Sufjan Stevens,Visions of Gideon,Mystery of Love,"I have loved you for the last time
Is it a video? Is it a video?
I have touched you for the last time
Is it a video? Is it a video?

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Is it a video? Is it a video?
For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Is it a video? Is it a video?
Is it a video?

I have loved you for the last time
Visions of Gideon, visions of Gideon
And I have kissed you for the last time

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms

For the love, for laughter, I flew up to your arms
Visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon), visions of Gideon, (visions of Gideon)

Sufjan Stevens,Death with Dignity,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"Spirit of my silence, I can hear you
But I’m afraid to be near you
And I don’t know where to begin
And I don’t know where to begin

Somewhere in the desert, there’s a forest
And an acre before us
But I don’t know where to begin
But I don’t know where to begin
Again, I've lost my strength completely, oh be near me
Tired, old mare with the wind in your hair

Amethyst and flowers on the table (On the table)
Is it real or a fable? (Is it real or a fable?)
Well, I suppose a friend is a friend
And we all know how this will end

Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper (Be my keeper)
Silhouette of the cedar (Silhouette of the cedar)
What is that song you sing for the dead?
What is that song you sing for the dead?
I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room
Well, I got nothing to prove
Well, I got nothing to prove


I forgive you, mother, I can hear you (I can hear you)
And I long to be near you (And I long to be near you)
But every road leads to an end
Yes, every road leads to an end
Your apparition passes through me in the willows
Five red hens – you’ll never see us again
You’ll never see us again",235
Sufjan Stevens,Casimir Pulaski Day,Illinois ,"Goldenrod and the 4H stone
The things I brought you when I found out
You had cancer of the bone
Your father cried on the telephone
And he drove his car into the Navy yard
Just to prove that he was sorry

In the morning, through the window shade
When the light pressed up against your shoulderblade
I could see what you were reading
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications you could do without
When I kissed you on the mouth

Tuesday night at the Bible study
We lift our hands and pray over your body
But nothing ever happens
I remember at Michael's house
In the living room when you kissed my neck
And I almost touched your blouse

In the morning at the top of the stairs
When your father found out what we did that night
And you told me you were scared
All the glory when you ran outside
With your shirt tucked in and your shoes untied
And you told me not to follow you

Sunday night when I cleaned the house
I find the card where you wrote it out
With the pictures of your mother
On the floor at the great divide
With my shirt tucked in and my shoes untied
I am crying in the bathroom

In the morning when you finally go
And the nurse runs in with her head hung low
And the cardinal hits the window
In the morning in the winter shade
On the first of March, on the holiday
I thought I saw you breathing
All the glory that the Lord has made
And the complications when I see His face
In the morning in the window
All the glory when He took our place
But He took my shoulders and He shook my face
And He takes and He takes and He takes",312
Sufjan Stevens,The Only Thing,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"The only thing that keeps me from driving this car
Half-light, jack knife into the canyon at night
Signs and wonders: Perseus aligned with the skull
Slain Medusa, Pegasus alight from us all

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises, I wonder did you love me at all?

The only thing that keeps me from cutting my arm
Cross hatch, warm bath, Holiday Inn after dark
Signs and wonders: water stain riding the wall
Daniel’s message; blood of the moon on us all

Do I care if I despise this? Nothing else matters, I know
In a veil of great disguises; how do I live with your ghost?

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow
I want to save you from your sorrow

The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart

Do I care if I survive this? Bury the dead where they’re found
In a veil of great surprises; hold to my head till I drown
Should I tear my eyes out now, before I see too much?
Should I tear my arms out now? I wanna feel your touch

Should I tear my eyes out now?
Everything I see returns to you, somehow
Should I tear my heart out now?
Everything I feel returns to you, somehow",269
Sufjan Stevens,All of Me Wants All of You,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"Shall we beat this or celebrate it?
You’re not the one to talk things through
You checked your texts while I masturbated
Manelich, I feel so used

Found myself on Spencer’s Butte
Traced your shadow with my shoe
Empty outline changed my view
Now all of me thinks less of you

On the sheet, I see your horizon
All of me pressed onto you
But in this light, you look like Poseidon
I’m just a ghost you walk right through

Saw myself on Spencer’s Butte (All of me wants all of you)
Landscape changed my point of view (All of me wants all of you)
Revelation may come true (All of me wants all of you)
Now all of me thinks less of you (All of me wants all of you)

(All of me wants all of you)
(All of me wants all of you)
(All of me wants all of you)
(All of me wants all of you)",159
Sufjan Stevens,John My Beloved,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"Are we to speak, first day of the week
Stumbling words at the bar
Beauty blue eyes, my order of fries
Long Island kindness and wine
Beloved of John, I get it all wrong
I read you for some kind of poem
Covered in lines, the fossils I find
Have they no life of their own?

So can we pretend, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I am a man with a heart that offends
With its lonely and greedy demands
There’s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

Such a waste, your beautiful face
Stumbling carpet arise
Go follow your gem, your white feathered friend
Icarus, point to the sun
If history speaks of two baby teeth
I’m painting the hills blue and red
They said beware, Lord, hear my prayer
I’ve wasted my throes on your head

So can we be friends, sweetly
Before the mystery ends?
I love you more than the world can contain
In its lonely and ramshackle head
There’s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead

I’m holding my breath
My tongue on your chest
What can be said of my heart?
If history speaks, the kiss on my cheek
Where there remains but a mark
Beloved, my John, so I’ll carry on
Counting my cards down to one
And when I am dead, come visit my bed
My fossil is bright in the sun

So can we contend, peacefully
Before my history ends?
Jesus, I need you, be near me, come shield me
From fossils that fall on my head
There’s only a shadow of me; in a matter of speaking, I'm dead",279
Sufjan Stevens,The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!,Illinois ,"Thinking outrageously I write in cursive
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
I see my own breath on the face of the door
Oh I am not quite sleeping
Oh I am fast in bed
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched
North of Savanna we swim in the Palisades
I come out wearing my brother's red hat
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
He runs washing his face in his hands
Oh how I meant to tease him
Oh how I meant no harm
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him
I see the wasp on the length of my arm
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu-
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu-

We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelu-
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Unto us your ghost is born. Hallelu-
I can't explain the state that I'm in
The state of my heart, he was my best friend
Into the car, from the back seat
Oh, admiration in falling asleep
All of my powers, day after day
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed
Deep in the tower, the prairies below
I can tell you— the telling gets old
Terrible sting and terrible storm
I can tell you the day we were born
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelu-
My friend is gone, he ran away
I can tell you, I love him each day
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelu-
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged
I can tell you I love him each day
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelu-
Terrible sting, terrible storm
I can tell you...
We were in love. We were in love
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait
Trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelu-",406
Sufjan Stevens,John Wayne Gacy Jr.,Illinois ,"His father was a drinker
And his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's t-shirts
When the swingset hit his head
The neighbors, they adored him
For his humor and his conversation
Look underneath the house there
Find the few living things, rotting fast, in their sleep
Oh, the dead
Twenty-seven people
Even more, they were boys
With their cars, summer jobs
Oh my God
Are you one of them?

He dressed up like a clown for them
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior
In a dark room on the bed
He kissed them all
He'd kill ten thousand people
With a sleight of his hand
Running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

And in my best behavior
I am really just like him
Look beneath the floorboards
For the secrets I have hid",162
Sufjan Stevens,No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"Now that I fell into your arms
My only lover
Give out to give in
I search for the capsule I lost

Drag me to hell in the valley of The Dalles
Like my mother
Give wings to a stone
It's only the shadow of a cross

I slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion
Get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart

I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire
Inhaling its fire
I'm chasing the dragon too far

There's blood on that blade
Fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin
Like Casper the ghost
There's no shade in the shadow of the cross",120
Sufjan Stevens,Futile Devices,The Age of Adz,"It's been a long, long time since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch, I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets, I cover up my face

I do love you
I do, ooh-ooh, love you

And when you play guitar, I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet, I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you, but saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

But you are the life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb
And words are futile devices",131
Sufjan Stevens,Chicago,Illinois ,"I fell in love again
All things go, all things go
Drove to Chicago
All things know, all things know
We sold our clothes to the state
I don't mind, I don't mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind

You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow
We had our mind set
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go

I drove to New York
In a van, with my friend
We slept in parking lots
I don't mind, I don't mind
I was in love with the place
In my mind, in my mind
I made a lot of mistakes
In my mind, in my mind

You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow
We had our mind set
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go

If I was crying
In the van, with my friend
It was for freedom
From myself and from the land
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes
I made a lot of mistakes

You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow
We had our mind set
All things know, all things know
You had to find it
All things go, all things go

You came to take us
All things go, all things go
To recreate us
All things grow, all things grow
We had our mind set (I made a lot of mistakes)
All things know, all things know (I made a lot of mistakes)
You had to find it (I made a lot of mistakes)
All things go, all things go (I made a lot of mistakes)",328
Sufjan Stevens,Eugene,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"Light struck from the lemon tree
What if I’d never seen hysterical light from Eugene?
Lemon yogurt
Remember I pulled at your shirt
I dropped the ashtray on the floor
I just wanted to be near you
Emerald Park, wonders never cease
The man who taught me to swim
He couldn't quite say my first name
Like a Father, he led community water on my head
And he called me “Subaru”
And now, I want to be near you
Since I was old enough to speak
I've said it with alarm
Some part of me was lost in your sleeve
Where you hid your cigarettes
No, I’ll never forget
I just want to be near you
Still, I pray to what I cannot see
In the sprinkler, I mark
The evidence known from the start
From the bed near your death
And all the machines that made a mess
Far away, the falcon flew
Now I want to be near you
What’s left is only bittersweet
For the rest of my life
Admitting the best is behind me
Now I’m drunk and afraid
Wishing the world would go away
What’s the point of singing songs
If they’ll never even hear you?",201
Sufjan Stevens,Drawn to the Blood,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"I’m drawn to the blood
The flight of a one-winged dove
How? How did this happen?
How? How did this happen?

The strength of his arm
My lover caught me off guard
How? Head of a rabbit
How? Head of a rabbit

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this?

With blood on my sleeve
Delilah, avenge my grief
How? God of Elijah
How? God of Elijah

As fire to the sun
Tell me what I have done
How? Heart of a dragon?
How? Heart of a dragon?

For my prayer has always been love
What did I do to deserve this now?
How did this happen?",113
Sufjan Stevens,Come On! Feel the Illinoise! (Part I: The World’s Columbian Exposition – Part II: Carl Sandburg Visits Me in a Dream),Illinois ,"Oh, great intentions
I've got the best of interventions
But when the ads come
I think about it now

In my infliction
Entrepreneurial conditions
Take us to glory
I think about it now

Cannot conversations cull united nations?
If you got the patience, celebrate the ancients
Cannot all creation call it celebration?
Or united nation, put it to your head

Oh, great white city
I've got the adequate committee
Where have your walls gone?
I think about it now

Chicago, in fashion
The soft drinks, expansion
Oh, Columbia!
From Paris, incentive
Like Cream of Wheat invented
The Ferris Wheel!

Oh, great intentions
Covenant with the imitation
Have you no conscience?
I think about it now

Oh, God of Progress
Have you degraded or forgot us?
Where have your laws gone?
I think about it now

Ancient hieroglyphic or the South Pacific
Typically terrific, busy and prolific
Classical devotion, architect promotion
Lacking in emotion, think about it now

Chicago, the New Age
But what would Frank Lloyd Wright say?
Oh, Columbia!
Amusement or treasure
These optimistic pleasures
Like the Ferris Wheel!

Cannot conversations cull united nations?
If you got the patience, celebrate the ancients
Columbia!


I cried myself to sleep last night
And the ghost of Carl, he approached my window
I was hypnotized, I was asked to improvise
On the attitude, the regret
Of a thousand centuries of death

Even with the heart of terror and the superstitious wearer
I am riding all alone
I am writing all alone
Even in my best condition
Counting all the superstition
I am riding all alone
I am running all alone

And we laughed at the beatitudes of a thousand lines
We were asked at the attitudes
They reminded us of death

Even with the rest belated, Everything is antiquated
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?
Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?

And I cried myself to sleep last night
For the Earth, and materials
They may sound just right to me

Even with the rest belated, everything is antiquated
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?
Even in his heart, the Devil has to know the water level
Are you writing from the heart?
Are you writing from the heart?",397
Sufjan Stevens,Carrie & Lowell,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"3, 4

Carrie and Lowell
Such a long time ago
Like a dead horse
Meadowlark, drive your arrow

Season of hope (after the flood)
Valentine, spurn my sorrow
Head on the floorboards (covered in blood)
Drunk as a horsefly
Climb on the mattress pad
Twist my arm

Under the pear tree
Shadows and light conspiring
Covered bridge, I scream
Cottage Grove shade, invite me

I will bow down (Dido's Lament)
Lord of the ancient waters
From the backyard (as far as she went)
Carrie surprised me
Erebus on my back
My lucky charm

Carried by stones
Fairyland all around us
Like a dead horse
Sign of your children’s fever

Carrie, come home (Thorazine’s friend)
Holding your hands with opal
Like a dead horse (Shall we ascend?)
Flight of the mayfly
Ephemera on my back
She breaks my arm",138
Sufjan Stevens,Blue Bucket of Gold,Carrie & Lowell (10th Anniversary Edition),"One, two, three

My blue bucket of gold
Friend, why don't you love me?
Once the myth has been told
The lens deforms it as lightning

Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life
(Ooh, ooh)

Search for things to extol
Friend, the fables delight me
My blue bucket of gold
Lord, touch me with lightning

Raise your right hand
Tell me you want me in your life
Or raise your red flag
Just when I want you in my life
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)",102
Sufjan Stevens,To Be Alone with You,Seven Swans,"I'd swim across Lake Michigan
I'd sell my shoes
I'd give my body to be back again
In the rest of the room

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your ghost

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

To be alone with me
You went up on a tree

I've never known a man who loved me",106
