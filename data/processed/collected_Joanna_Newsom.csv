Joanna Newsom,Only Skin,Ys,"And there was a booming above you
That night black airplanes flew over the sea
And they were lowing and shifting like
Beached whales
Shelled snails
As you strained and you squinted to see
The retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry
You froze in your sand shoal
Prayed for your poor soul;
Sky was a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl
And when the bread broke —
Fell in bricks of wet smoke —
My sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke
Then there was a silence you took to mean something:
Mean, Run, sing
For alive you will evermore be
And the plague of the greasy black engines a-skulking
Has gone east
While you’re left to explain them to me —
Released
From their hairless and blind cavalry
With your hands in your pockets
Stubbily running
To where I’m unfresh
Undressed and yawning —
Well, what is this craziness?
This crazy talking?
You caught some small death
When you were sleepwalking
It was a dark dream, darlin;
It’s over
The firebreather is beneath the clover
Beneath his breathing there is cold clay, forever:
A toothless hound-dog choking on a feather
But I took my fishing pole (fearing your fever)
Down to the swimming hole, where there grows a bitter herb
That blooms but one day a year, by the riverside —
I’d bring it here:
Apply it gently
To the love you’ve lent me
While the river was twisting and braiding, the bait bobbed
And the string sobbed
As it cut through the hustling breeze
And I watched how the water was kneading so neatly
Gone treacly
Nearly slowed to a stop in this heat;
In a frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath
Press on me
We are restless things
Webs of seaweed are swaddling
You call upon the dusk of the
Musk of a squid:
Shot full of ink, until you sink into your crib
Rowing along, among the reeds, among the rushes
I heard your song, before my heart had time to hush it!
Smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened
Smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking
And when the fire moves away
Fire moves away, son
Why would you say
I was the last one?
Scrape your knee: it is only skin
Makes the sound of violins
And when I cut your hair, and leave the birds all of the trimmings
I am the happiest woman among all women
And the shallow water stretches as far as I can see
Knee deep, trudging along —
The seagull weeps ‘so long’ —
I’m humming a threshing song —
Until the night is over, hold on
Hold on;
Hold your horses back from the fickle dawn
I have got some business out at the edge of town
Candy weighing both of my pockets down
Till I can hardly stay afloat, from the weight of them
(and knowing how the commonfolk condemn
What it is I do, to you, to keep you warm:
Being a woman. Being a woman.)
But always up the mountainside you’re clambering
Groping blindly, hungry for anything;
Picking through your pocket linings —
Well, what is this?
Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus?
I see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain
Little sister, he will be back again
I have washed a thousand spiders down the drain
Spiders’ ghosts hang, soaked and dangling
Silently from all the blooming cherry trees
In tiny nooses, safe from everyone —
Nothing but a nuisance; gone now, dead and done —
Be a woman. Be a woman
Though we felt the spray of the waves
We decided to stay, 'till the tide rose too far
We weren’t afraid, 'cause we know what you are;
And you know that we know what you are
Awful atoll —
O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow!
Bawl bellow:
Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow
Toddle and roll;
Teethe an impalpable bit of leather
While yarrow, heather and hollyhock
Awkwardly molt along the shore
Are you mine?
My heart?
Mine anymore?
Stay with me for awhile
That’s an awfully real gun
And though life will lay you down
As the lightning has lately done
Failing this, failing this
Follow me, my sweetest friend
To see what you anointed
In pointing your gun there
Lay it down! Nice and slow!
There is nowhere to go
Save up;
Up where the light, undiluted, is
Weaving, in a drunk dream
At the sight of my baby, out back:
Back on the patio
Watching the bats bring night in
— while, elsewhere
Estuaries of wax-white
Wend, endlessly, towards seashores unmapped
Last week, our picture window
Produced a half-word
Heavy and hollow
Hit by a brown bird
We stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake
And pant and labor over every intake
I said a sort of prayer for some rare grace
Then thought I ought to take her to a higher place
Said, “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you
And though you die, bird, you will have a fine view.”
Then in my hot hand, she slumped her sick weight
We tramped through the poison oak, heartbroke and inchoate
The dogs were snapping and you cuffed their collars
While I climbed the treehouse. Then how I hollered!
Where she’d lain, as still as a stone, in my palm, for a lifetime or two;
Then saw the treetops, cocked her head, and up and flew
(While back in the world that moves, often, according to
The hoarding of these clues)
Dogs still run roughly around
Little tufts of finch-down
And the cities we passed were a flickering wasteland,
But his hand, in my hand, made them hale and harmless
While down in the lowlands, the crops are all coming;
We have everything
Life is thundering blissful towards death
In a stampede
Of his fumbling green gentleness
You stopped by;
I was all alive
In my doorway, we shucked and jived
And when you wept, I was gone;
See, I got gone when I got wise
But I can’t with certainty say we survived
Then down and down
And down and down
And down and deeper
Stoke, without sound
The blameless flames
You endless sleeper
Through fire below
And fire above
And fire within
Sleep through the things that couldn’t have been
If you hadn’t have been
And when the fire moves away
Fire moves away, son
Why would you say
I was the last one?
All my bones, they are gone, gone, gone
Take my bones, I don’t need none
Cold, cold cupboard, lord, nothing to chew on!
Suck all day on a cherry stone
Dig a little hole not three inches round —
Spit your pit in a hole in the ground
Weep upon the spot for the starving of me!
Till up grows a fine young cherry tree
When the bough breaks, what’ll you make for me?
A little willow cabin to rest on your knee
What’ll I do with a trinket such as this?
Think of your woman, who’s gone to the west
But I’m starving and freezing in my measly old bed!
Then I’ll crawl across the salt flats, to stroke your sweet head
Come across the desert with no shoes on!
I love you truly
Or I love no-one
Fire moves away. Fire moves away, son
Why would you say that I was the last one, last one?
Clear the room! There’s a fire, a fire, a fire
Get going
And I’m going to be right behind you
And if the love of a woman or two, dear
Could move you to such heights
Then all I can do
Is do, my darling, right by you",1287
Joanna Newsom,Sapokanikan,Divers,"The cause is Ozymandian
The map of Sapokanikan
Is sanded and bevelled
The land lone and levelled
By some unrecorded and powerful hand
Which plays along the monument
And drums upon a plastic bag
The brave-men-and-women-so-dear-to-God-
And-famous-to-all-of-the-ages rag
Sing: Do you love me?
Will you remember?
The snow falls above me
The renderer renders:
The event is in the hand of God
Beneath a patch of grass, her
Bones the old Dutch master hid
While elsewhere Tobias
And the angel disguise
What the scholars surmise was a mother and kid
Interred with other daughters
In dirt in other potter's fields
Above them, parades
Mark the passing of days
Through parks where pale colonnades arch in marble and steel
Where all of the twenty-thousand attending your footfall
And the cause that they died for are lost in the idling bird calls
And the records they left are cryptic at best
Lost in obsolescence
The text will not yield, nor x-ray reveal
With any fluorescence
Where the hand of the master begins and ends
I fell, I tried to do well but I won't be
Will you tell the one that I loved to remember and hold me
I call and call for the doctor
But the snow swallows me whole with ol' Florry Walker
And the event lives only in print
He said:
""It's alright, and it's all over now""
And boarded the plane
His belt unfastened
The boy was known to show unusual daring
And, called a ""boy""
This alderman, confounding Tammany Hall
In whose employ King Tamanend himself preceded John’s fall
So we all raise a standard
To which the wise and honest soul may repair
To which a hunter
A hundred years from now, may look and despair
And see with wonder
The tributes we have left to rust in the park
Swearing that our hair stood on end
To see John Purroy Mitchel depart
For the Western Front
Where work might count
All exeunt! All go out!
Await the hunter, to decipher the stone
(and what lies under, now)
The city is gone
Look and despair
Look and despair",352
Joanna Newsom,Emily,Ys,"The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow
Set to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh
Little while later the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow
Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?
There is a rusty light on the pines tonight;
Sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow, into the
Bones of the birches, and the spires of the churches, jutting out from the shadows;
The yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks, and the bale, and the barrow—
And everything sloped, like it was dragged from a rope, in the mouth of the south below
We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey
We thought our very hearts would up and melt away
From that snow in the nighttime
Just going and going
And the stirring of wind chimes
In the morning
In the morning
Helps me find my way back in
From the place where I have been—
And, Emily, I saw you last night by the river
I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water—
Frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever
In a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror
Anyhow, I sat by your side, by the water
You taught me the names of the stars overhead, that I wrote down in my ledger—
Though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades, loosed in December
I promised you I'd set them to verse so I'd always remember

That the meteorite is the source of the light
And the meteor's just what we see;
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee
And the meteorite’s just what causes the light
And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;
And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void, that lies quiet in offering to thee

You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in;
Threw the windows wide and cried, ""Amen! Amen! Amen!""
The whole world stopped to hear you hollering
You looked down, and saw, now, what was happening:
The lines are fading in my kingdom
(Though I have never known the way to border them in);
So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows, and the grouse, and the horse, and the hen
Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen
And the mail is late, and the great estates are not lit from within
The talk in town's becoming downright sickening
In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare
I've seen your bravery, and I will follow you there
And row through the nighttime
So healthy
Gone healthy all of a sudden
In search of a midwife
Who can help me
Who can help me
Help me find my way back in
And there are worries where I've been
And say, say, say, in the lee of the bay
Don't be bothered
Leave your troubles here
Where the tugboats shear the water from the water
(Flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper)
Emily, they'll follow your lead by the letter
And I make this claim, and I'm not ashamed to say I knew you better
What they've seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter
Let us go! Though we know it's a hopeless endeavor
The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined, and hold us close forever
Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with
A sky that is gaping and yawning
There is a song I woke with on my lips
As you sailed your great ship towards the morning
Come on home. The poppies are all grown knee-deep by now
Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow
Peonies nod in the breeze
And while they wetly bow
With hydrocephalitic listlessness
Ants mop up their brow
And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour;
The butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours
And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines—
Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines
Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight
The way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light
Squint skyward and listen—
Loving him, we move within his borders:
Just asterisms in the stars' set order
We could stand for a century
Staring
With our heads cocked
In the broad daylight at this thing:
Joy
Landlocked in bodies that don’t keep—
Dumbstruck with the sweetness of being
Till we don’t be
Told: take this
Eat this

Told: the meteorite is the source of the light
And the meteor's just what we see;
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee
And the meteorite’s just what causes the light
And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;
And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee",848
Joanna Newsom,Sawdust and Diamonds,Ys,"From the top of the flight
Of the wide, white stairs
Through the rest of my life
Do you wait for me there?
There's a bell in my ears
There's the wide, white roar
Drop a bell down the stairs
Hear it fall forevermore
Hear it fall forevermore
Drop a bell off of the dock
Blot it out in the sea
Drowning mute as a rock;
And sounding mutiny
There's a light in the wings, hits the system of strings
From the side, where they swing —
See the wires, the wires, the wires
And the articulation in our elbows and knees
Makes us buckle;
And we couple in endless increase
As the audience admires
And the little white dove
Made with love, made with love;
Made with glue, and a glove, and some pliers
Swings a low sickle arc, from its perch in the dark:
Settle down, settle down, my desire
And the moment I slept, I was swept up in a terrible tremor
Though no longer bereft, how I shook! And I couldn't remember
And then the furthermost shake drove a murthering stake in
And cleft me right down through my center
And I shouldn’t say so, but I know that it was then, or never
Push me back into a tree
Bind my buttons with salt
Fill my long ears with bees
Praying please please please love
You ought not
No you ought not
And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings
(cut from cardboard and old magazines):
Makes me warble and rise, like a sparrow
And in the place where I stood, there is a circle of wood —
A cord or two — which you chop, and you stack in your barrow
It is terribly good to carry water and chop wood
Streaked with soot, heavy-booted and wild-eyed;
As I crash through the rafters
And the ropes and the pulleys trail after
And the holiest belfry burns sky-high
And then the slow lip of fire moves across the prairie with precision
While, somewhere, with your pliers and glue, you make your first incision
And in a moment of almost-unbearable vision
Doubled over with the hunger of lions
Hold me close, cooed the dove
Who was stuffed, now, with sawdust and diamonds
I wanted to say: Why the long face
Sparrow, perch and play songs of long face
Burro, buck and bray songs of long face!
Sing, I will swallow your sadness, and eat your cold clay
Just to lift your long face;
And though it may be madness, I will take to the grave
Your precious longface
And though our bones they may break, and our souls separate-
Why the long face?
And though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil-
Why the long face?
And in the trough of the waves
Which are pawing like dogs
Pitch we, pale-faced and grave
As I write in my log
Then I hear a noise from the hull
Seven days out to sea
And it is the damnable bell!
And it tolls — well, I believe that it tolls — it tolls for me
And it tolls for me
And though my wrists and my waist seemed so easy to break
Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water
And they will recognize all the lines of your face
In the face of the daughter of the daughter of my daughter
And darling, we will be fine; but what was yours and mine
Appears to me a sandcastle
That the gibbering wave takes
But if it's all just the same, then will you say my name;
Say my name in the morning, so that I know when the wave breaks
I wasn't born of a whistle, or milked from a thistle at twilight
No; I was all horns and thorns, sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and upright
So: enough of this terror
We deserve to know light
And grow evermore lighter and lighter
You would have seen me through
But I could not undo that desire
O, desire!
O, desire!
O, desire!
Desire, desire, desire, desire
From the top of the flight
Of the wide, white stairs
Through the rest of my life
Do you wait for me there?",714
Joanna Newsom,"Peach, Plum, Pear",The Milk-Eyed Mender,"We speak in the store
I'm a sensitive bore
You seem markedly more
And I'm oozing surprise
But it's late in the day
And you're well on your way
What was golden went gray
And I'm suddenly shy
And the gathering floozies
Afford to be choosy
And all sneezing darkly
In the dimming divide
And I have read the right books
To interpret your look
You were knocking me down
With the palm of your eye

Oh, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na

This was unlike the story
It was written to be
I was riding its back
When it used to ride me
And we were galloping manic
To the mouth of the source
We were swallowing panic
In the face of its force
And I am blue
I am blue and unwell
Made me bolt like a horse

Oh, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na
Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na

Now it's done
Watch it go
You've changed some
Water runs from the snow
Am I so dear?
Do I run rare?
And you've changed some
Peach, plum, pear
Peach, plum",190
Joanna Newsom,"Time, As a Symptom",Divers,"(Mourning Dove calls)
Time passed hard
And the task was the hardest thing she'd ever do
But she forgot
The moment she saw you
So it would seem to be true:
When cruel birth debases, we forget
When cruel death debases
We believe it erases all the rest
That precedes
But stand brave, life-liver
Bleeding out your days
In the river of time
Stand brave:
Time moves both ways
In the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life;
The nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life
The moment of your greatest joy sustains:
Not axe nor hammer
Tumor, tremor
Can take it away, and it remains
It remains
And it pains me to say, I was wrong
Love is not a symptom of time
Time is just a symptom of love
(and the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life;
The nullifying, defeating, negating, repeating
Joy of life)
Hardly seen, hardly felt–
Deep down where your fight is waiting
Down 'till the light in your eyes is fading:
Joy of life
Where I know that you can yield, when it comes down to it;
Bow like the field when the wind combs through it:
Joy of life
And every little gust that chances through
Will dance in the dust of me and you
With joy-of-life
And in our perfect secret-keeping:
One ear of corn
In silent, reaping
Joy of life
Joy! Again, around–a pause, a sound–a song:
A way a lone a last a loved a long
A cave, a grave, a day: arise, ascend
(Areion, Rharian, go free and graze. Amen.)
A shore, a tide, unmoored–a sight, abroad:
A dawn, unmarked, undone, undarked (a god)
No time. No flock. No chime, no clock. No end
White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: transcend!
White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: transcend!
White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: transcend!
White star, white ship–Nightjar, transmit: trans-",310
Joanna Newsom,Monkey & Bear,Ys,"Down in the green hay
Where monkey and bear usually lay
They woke from a stable-boy’s cry
He said: “someone come quick —
The horses got loose, got grass-sick —
They’ll founder! Fain, they’ll die.”
What is now known by the sorrel and the roan?
By the chestnut, and the bay, and the gelding grey?
It is: stay by the gate you are given
Remain in your place, for your season
O, had the overfed dead but listened
To that high-fence, horse-sense, wisdom…
But
“Did you hear that, Bear?” said
Monkey, “we’ll get out of here, fair and square
They've left the gate open wide!
“So, my bride
“Here is my hand. Where is your paw?
Try and understand my plan, Ursula
My heart is a furnace
Full of love that is just, and earnest
Now you know that we must unlearn this
Allegiance to a life of service
And no longer answer to that heartless
Hay-monger, nor be his accomplice —
(that charlatan, with artless hustling!)
But Ursula, we’ve got to eat something
And earn our keep, while still within
The borders of the land that man has girded
(all double-bolted and tightfisted!)
Until we reach the open country
A-steeped in milk and honey
Will you keep your fancy clothes on, for me?
Can you bear a little longer to wear that leash?
“My love, I swear by the air I breathe:
Sooner or later, you’ll bare your teeth
“But for now, just dance, darling
C’mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there’s a place for us;
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
My darling there’s a place for us
“Oh darling. C'mon will you dance
My darling?
The hills are groaning with excess
Like a table ceaselessly being set
O my darling, we will get there yet”
They trooped past the guards
Past the coops, and the fields, and the
Farmyards, all night, till finally
The space they gained
Grew much farther than
The stone that Bear threw
To mark where they’d stop for tea
But
“Walk a little faster
Don’t look backwards —
“your feast is to the East, which lies a little past the pasture
“When the blackbirds hear tea whistling they rise and clap
Their applause caws the kettle black
And we can’t have none of that!
Move along, Bear; there, there; that’s that.”
(Though cast in plaster
Our Ursula’s heart beat faster
Than monkey’s ever will.)
But still
They have got to pay the bills
Hadn’t they?
That is what the monkey'd say
So, with the courage of a clown, or a cur
Or a kite, jerking tight at its tether
In her dun-brown gown of fur
And her jerkin of
Swansdown and leather
Bear would sway on her hind legs;
The organ would grind dregs of song
For the pleasure
Of the children who’d shriek
Throwing coins at her feet
Then recoiling in terror
Sing, “dance, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
Darling, there’s a place for us;
Can we go, before I turn to dust?
Oh, my darling there’s a place for us
“Oh, darling
C'mon, will you dance, my darling?
You keep your eyes fixed on the highest hill
Where you’ll ever-after eat your fill
O my darling…dear…mine…if you dance
Dance, darling: and I'll love you still.”
Deep in the night
Shone a weak and miserly light
Where the monkey shouldered his lamp
Someone had told him the
Bear'd been wandering a fair piece away
From where they were camped
Someone had told him
The bear had been sneaking away
To the seaside caverns, to bathe;
And the thought troubled the monkey
For he was afraid of spelunking
Down in those caves
And also afraid what the
Village people would say
If they saw the bear in that state —
Lolling and splashing obscenely
Well, it seemed irrational, really
Washing that face;
Washing that matted and flea-bit pelt
In some sea-spit-shine —
Old kelp dripping with brine
But monkey just laughed, and he muttered
“When she comes back, Ursula will be bursting with pride —
Till I jump up!
Saying, ‘You've been rolling in muck!
Saying, ‘You smell of garbage and grime!’”
But far out, far out
By now, by now —
Far out, by now, Bear ploughed
Because she would not drown:
First the outside-legs of the bear
Up and fell down, in the water, like knobby garters
Then the outside-arms of the bear
Fell off, as easy as if sloughed
From boiled tomatoes
Low’red in a genteel curtsy
Bear shed the mantle of her
Diluvian shoulders;
And, with a sigh
She allowed the burden of belly to drop
Like an apron full of boulders
If you could hold up her
Threadbare coat to the light
Where it’s worn translucent in places
You’d see spots where
Almost every night of the year
Bear had been mending
Suspending that baseness
Now her coat drags through the water
Bagging, with a life’s-worth of hunger
Limitless minnows;
In the magnetic embrace
Balletic and glacial
Of bear’s insatiable shadow —
Left there! Left there!
When bear left bear;
Left there, left there
When bear stepped clear of bear
(Sooner or later you'll bury your teeth)",864
Joanna Newsom,Cosmia,Ys,"When you ate
I saw your eyelashes
Saw them shake like
Wind on rushes
In the cornfield
When she called me
Moths surround me
Thought they'd drown me
And I miss your precious heart
And I miss your precious heart
Dried rose petals, redbrown circles
Framed your eyes and
Stained your knuckles
Dried rose petals, redbrown circles
Framed your eyes and
Stained your knuckles
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
You brought me bread and water
(Water, in.);
But though I tried so hard
My little darlin
I couldn't keep the night from coming in
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
I was brought my bread and water
By the kith and the kin;
Now in the quiet hour
When I am sleeping
I cannot keep the night from coming in
Why've you gone away?
Gone away again?
I'll sleep through the rest of my days
If you've gone away again
I'll sleep through the rest of my days
And I'll sleep through the rest of my days
And I'll sleep through the rest of my days
Why've you gone away
Seven suns, seven suns away
Away, away, away
Can you hear me? Will you listen?
Don't come near me. Don't go missing
And in the lissome light of evening:
Help me, Cosmia; I'm grieving
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
You brought me bread and water
(Water, in.);
But though I tried so hard
My little darlin
I couldn't keep the night from coming in
And all those lonely nights
Down by the river
Brought my bread and water
In the kith and the kin;
Now in the quiet hour
When I am sleeping
I cannot keep the night from coming in
*
Beneath the porch-light
We've all been circling
Beat our dust hearts;
Singe our flour wings
But in the corner
Something is happening!
Wild Cosmia, what have you seen?
Water were your limbs
And the fire was your hair —
And then the moonlight caught your eye
And you rose through the air
Well, if you've seen true light
Then this is my prayer:
Will you call me, when you get there?
And I miss your precious heart;
And I miss your precious heart;
And miss, and miss, and miss
And miss, and miss, and
Miss, and miss, and miss your heart
But release your precious heart
To its feast, for precious hearts",405
Joanna Newsom,Have One on Me,Have One on Me,"From the courtyard, I floated in and watched it go down
Heard the cup drop, thought, ""Well, that's why they keep them around""
The blackguard sat hard down with no head on him now
And I felt so bad, 'cause I didn't know how
To feel bad enough to make him proud

By the time you read this, I will be so far away
Daddy Longlegs, how in the world am I to be expected to stay?
In the night, in the night, you may hear me call
Pa, stay your hand and steel your resolve
Stay where you are, so long and tall

Here's Lola — ta da! — to do her famous Spider Dance for you
Lighten up your pockets
Shake her skirts and scatter there
A shrieking, six-legged millionaire with a blight in his sockets

Saying, ""Pretty papa, if you are my friend
Mister Daddy Longlegs, they are at it again
Can I see you?""

Poor Lola, a tarantula's mounting Countess Lansfeld's handsome brassiere
While they all cheer
And the old king fell from grace while Lola fled
To save face and her career

You caught a fly floating by
Wait for him to drown in the dust, drown in the dust of other flies
Whereby the machine is run and the deed is done
Heaven has no word for the way you and your friends have treated poor Louis

May god save your poor soul, Lola
But there is nothing I adore, apart
From that whore's black heart

""Well, doesn't that just beat all!""
Miss Gilbert called to Castlemaine by the silver dollar
And the gold glitter
Well, I've seen lots, but never in a million years
Would think to see you here

Though the long road begins and ends with you
I cannot seem to make amends with you, Louis
When we go out
They're bound to see you with me

At night, I walk in the park with a whip
Between the lines of the whispering Jesuits
Who are poisoning you against me
There's a big black spider hanging over my door
Can't go anywhere anymore
Tell me, are you with me?

I called to you several times
While the change took place and then arrived all night
And I died
But all these songs, when you and I are long gone
Will carry on, mud in your eye

You asked my hand, hired a band
""In your heart is all that you need
Ask and you will receive,"" it is said
I threw my bouquet and I knocked 'em dead
Bottle of white, bottle of red
Helpless as a child when you held me in your arms
And I knew that no other could ever love me as you loved
Love me as you loved, but help me, I'm leaving

I remember everything
Down to the sound of you shaving, the scrape of your razor
The dully-abrading black hair that remained
When you clutched at me

That night I came upstairs, half-dead
And in your kindness, you put me straightaway
In the cupboard with a bottle of champagne
And then, later, on a train, it was dark out, I was half-dead
I saw a star fall into the sky like a chunk of thrown coal
As if god himself spat like a cornered rat
I really want you to do this for me, will you have one on me?

It was dark, I was drunk and half-dead
And we slept, knocking heads
Sitting up in the star-smoking air
Knocking heads like buoys
Don't you worry for me, will you have one on me!

Meanwhile, I will raise my own glass
To how you made me fast and expendable
And I will drink to your excellent health
And your cruelty, will you have one on me?

Helpless as a child when you held me in your arms
And I knew that no other could ever love me

Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-ooh

From the courtyard, I floated in and watched it go down
Heard the cup drop, thought, ""Well, that's why they keep them around""
The blackguard sat hard down with no head on him now
And I felt so bad, 'cause I didn't know how
To feel bad enough to make him proud

Well daddy longlegs, are you?
Daddy longlegs, are you?
Daddy longlegs, are you proud?",743
Joanna Newsom,Anecdotes,Divers,"Sending the first scouts over
Back from the place beyond the dawn:
Horse, bear your broken soldier
Eyes frozen wide at what went on
And Time, in our camp, is moving
As you’d anticipate it to
But what is this sample proving?
Anecdotes cannot say what Time may do
I kid with Rufous Nightjar
When our men are all asleep:
“It ain’t about how rare you are
But how hard you are to see
Take, you and me—""
“When are you from?” said he
In our blind of winter leaves
As we sighted out their fliers
In the grayscale of the night
Fumbled on the bare ground
To bury round landmines
While the dew lay down and dried
We signal Private Poorwill, when morning starts to loom:
“Pull up from your dive!”
Till we hear the telltale 
Boom
Too soon—
Hotdogging loon, caught there
Like a shard of mirror in the moon!
Now they’ve stopped giving orders
But I follow anyway
Laying in our state of torpor
Waiting out the day
While the dew burns away
Rushing, tearing, speeding home:
Bound to a wheel that is not my own
Where round every bend I long to see
Temporal infidelity
Then all along the road, the lights stream by
I want to go where the dew won’t dry
I want to go where the light won’t bend—
Far as the eye may reach—nor end
But, inasmuch as that light is loaned
And, insofar as we’ve borrowed bones
Must every debt now be repaid
In star-spotted, sickle-winged night raids
While we sing to the garden, and we sing to the stars
And we sing in the meantime
Wherever you are?
In the folds and the branches
Somewhere, out there
I was only just born into open air
Now hush, little babe
You don’t want to be
Down in the trenches
Remembering with me
Where you will not mark my leaving
And you will not hear my parting song
Nor is there cause for grieving
Nor is there cause for carrying on
—and 
daughter
, when you are able
Come down and join! The kettle’s on
And your family’s round the table
Will you come down, before the 
sun
 is 
gone
?",369
Joanna Newsom,Divers,Divers,"The diver is my love
(And I am his, if I am not deceived)
Who takes one breath above, for every hour below the sea;
Who gave to me a jewel
Worth twice this woman's life (but would cost her less
Than laying at low tide
To see her true love phosphoresce)
And in an infinite regress:
Tell me, why is the pain of birth
Lighter borne than the pain of death?
I ain't saying that I loved you first
But I loved you best
I know we must abide
Each by the rules that bind us here:
The divers, and the sailors, and the women on the pier
But how do you choose your form?
How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life?
How do you choose the time you must exhale
And kick, and rise?
And in an infinite capsize:
Like a bull tearing down the coast
Double hulls bearing double masts —
I don’t know if you loved me most, but you loved me last
Recall the word you gave:
To count your way across the depths of this arid world
Where you would yoke the waves
And lay a bed of shining pearls!
I dream it every night:
The ringing of the pail
The motes of sand dislodged
The shucking, quick and bright;
The twinned and cast-off shells reveal a single heart of white
And in an infinite backslide:
Ancient border, sink past the West
Like a sword at the bearer's fall
I can't claim that I knew you best
But did you know me at all?
A woman is alive!
A woman is alive;
You do not take her for a sign in nacre on a stone
Alone, unfaceted and fine
And never will I wed
I'll hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life
And ever hold my breath
Till I may be the diver's wife
See how the infinite divides:
And the divers are not to blame
For the rift, spanning distant shores
You don’t know my name
But I know yours",346
Joanna Newsom,Good Intentions Paving Co.,Have One on Me,"Twenty miles left to the show
Hello, my old country, hello
Stars are just beginning to appear
And I have never, in my life, before been here
And it's my heart, not me, who cannot drive
At which conclusion you arrived
Watching me sit here, bolt upright and cry
For no good reason at the Eastering sky

And the tilt of this strange nation
And the will to remain for the duration
Waving the flag, feeling it drag
Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby
Like I'm in a fistfight with the fog, baby
Step, ball-change, and a-pirouette!
And I regret, I regret

How I said to you, ""Honey, just open your heart,""
When I've got trouble even opening a honey jar
And that, right there, is where we are

And I've been 'fessin' double-fast
Addressing questions nobody asked
I'll get this joy off of my chest at last
And I will love you 'til the noise has long since passed
And I did not mean to shout, just drive
Just get us out, dead or alive
The road's too long to mention— Lord, it's something to see!
Laid down by the Good Intentions Paving Company

All the way to the thing we've been playing at, darling
I can see that you're wearing your staying-hat, darling
For the time being, all is well
Won't you love me a spell?
This is blindness beyond all conceiving
While, behind us, the road is leaving
And leaving, and falling back
Like a rope gone slack

And I saw straightaway that the lay was steep
But I fell for you, honey, easy as falling asleep
And that, right there, is the course I keep

And no amount of talking is going to soften the fall
But, like after the rain, step out of the overhang, that's all
It had a nice ring to it when the old opry house rang
So, with a solemn auld lang 
syne, sealed, delivered, I sang
And there is hesitation and it always remains
Concerning you, me, and the rest of the gang
And in our quiet hour, I feel I see everything
And am in love with the hook upon which everyone hangs.
And I know you meant to show the extent
To which you gave a goddang
You ranged real hot and real cold, but I'm sold
I am home on that range
And I do hate to fold
Right here, at the top of my game
When I've been trying with my whole heart and soul
To stay right here, in the right lane
But it can make you feel over, and old
(Lord, you know it's a shame)
When I only want for you to pull over and hold me
'Til I can't remember my own name",465
Joanna Newsom,Baby Birch,Have One on Me,"This is the song for Baby Birch
I will never know you
And at the back of what we've done
There is the knowledge of you

Well, I wish we could take every path
Could spend a hundred years adoring you
Yes, I wish we could take every path
'Cause you know I hated to close the door on you

Do you remember staring up at the stars
So far away in their bulletproof cars?
When we heard the rushing, slow intake
Of the dark, dark water and the engine breaks

And I said, how about them engine breaks?
And, if I should die before I wake
Will you keep an eye on Baby Birch?
Because I'd hate to see her make the same mistake

When it was dark, I called and you came
When it was dark, I saw shapes
When I see stars, I feel in your hand
And I see stars and I reel again

Well mercy me. I'll be goddamned
It's been a long, long time since I last saw you
And I have never known the plan
It's been a long, long time, how are you?

Your eyes are green, your hair is gold
Your hair is black, your eyes are blue
I closed the ranks, and I doubled back
But you know I hated to close the doggone door on you

We take a walk along the dirty lake
Hear the goose cussing at me over her eggs
You poor little cousin, I don't want your dregs
A little baby fussing over my legs
There is a blacksmith and there is a shepherd
And there is a butcher-boy
And there is a barber who's cutting and cutting away
At my only joy
I saw a rabbit as slick as a knife
And as pale as a candlestick
And I had thought it'd be harder to do
But I caught her, and skinned her quick
Held her there, kicking and mewling
Upended, unspooling, unsung and blue
Told her ""Wherever you go, little runaway bunny, I will find you""
And then she ran, as they're liable to do

Be at peace baby, and be gone
Be at peace baby, and be gone",366
Joanna Newsom,Leaving the City,Divers,"Hay, and a clean stall
And ivy on a garden wall
And a sign saying Sold
And an old coat
For the bad cold
I believe in you
Do you believe in me?
What do you want to do?
Are we leaving the city?
On the black road
Through the gold fields
While the fields are plowed
Towards what we are allowed..
The bridle bends in idle hands
And slows your canter to a trot
We mean to stop, in increments, but can’t commit
We post and sit, in impotence:
The harder you hit, the deeper the dent
We seek our name
We seek our fame, and our credentials
(Paned in glass, trained to master incidentals)
Bleach our collar, leach our dollar from our cents:
The longer you live, the higher the rent
Beneath the pale sky
Beside the red barn
Below the white clouds
Is all we are allowed
Here, the light will seep
And the scythe will reap
And spirit will rend, in counting toward the end
In December of that year
The word came down that she was here
The days grew shorter
I was sure, if she came 'round
I’d hold my ground. I'd endure
But they'd alluded to a change
That came to pass
And Spring, deranged
Weeping grass and sleepless
Broke herself upon my windowglass
And I could barely breathe, for seeing
All the splintered light that leaked her fissures
Fleeing, launched in flight:
Unstaunched daylight, brightly bleeding
Bleached the night with dawn, deleting
In that high sun
After our good run
When the spirit bends
Beneath knowing it must end
And that is all I want here:
To draw my gaunt spirit to bow
Beneath what I am allowed
Beneath what I am allowed",291
Joanna Newsom,Go Long,Have One on Me,"Last night, again, you were in my dreams
Several expendable limbs were at stake
You were a prince, spinning rims
All sentiments Indian-given and half-baked

I was brought in on a palanquin
Made of the many bodies of beautiful women
Brought to this place to be examined
Swaying on an elephant, a princess of India

We both want the very same thing
We are praying I am the one to save you
But you don't even own your own violence
Run away from home, your beard is still blue

With the loneliness of you mighty men
With your jaws, and fists, and guitars and pens
And your sugarlip, but I've never been
To the firepits with you mighty men

Who made you this way, who made you this way?
Who is going to bear your beautiful children?
Do you think you can just stop when you're ready for a change?
Who will take care of you when you're old and dying?

You burn in the Mekong to prove your worth
Go long, go long, right over the edge of the earth
You have been wronged, tore up since birth
You have done harm, others have done worse

Will you tuck your shirt, will you leave it loose?
You are badly hurt, you're a silly goose
You are caked in mud, and in blood and worse
Chew your bitter cud, grope your little nurse

Do you know why my ankles are bound in gauze?
Sickly dressage, a princess of Kentucky
In the middle of the woods which were the probable cause
We danced in the lodge like two panting monkeys

I will give you a call for one last hurrah
And if this tale is tall, forgive my scrambling
But you keep palming along the wall
Moving at a blind crawl, but always rambling

Wolf-spider, crouch in your funnel nest
If I knew you once, now I know you less
In the sinking sand where we've come to rest
Have I had a hand in your loneliness?

When you leave me alone in this old palace of yours
It starts to get to me. I take to walking
What a woman does is open doors
And it is not a question of locking or unlocking

Well, I have never seen such a terrible room
Gilded with the gold teeth of the women who loved you
Now, though I die, Magpie, this I bequeath
By any other name, a jay is still blue

With the loneliness of you mighty men
With your mighty kiss that might never, never end
While so far away, in the seat of the west
Burns the fount of the heat of that loneliness

There's a man who only will speak in code
Backing slowly, slowly down the road
May he master everything that such men may know
About loving and then letting go",476
Joanna Newsom,In California,Have One on Me,"My heart became a drunken runt
On the day I sunk in this shunt to tap me clean
Of all the wonder and the sorrow I have seen
Since I left my home:
My home on the old Milk Lake
Where the darkness does fall so fast it feels like some kind of mistake
Just like they told you it would
Just like the Tulgey Wood

When I came into my land, I did not understand
Neither dry rot, nor the burn pile
Nor the bark-beetle, nor the dry well
Nor the black bear

But there is another who is a little older
When I broke my bone, he carried me up from the riverside
To spend my life in spitting distance of the love that I have known
I must stay here in an endless eventide
And if you come and see me, you will upset the order
You cannot come and see me, for I set myself apart
But when you come and see me in California
You cross the border of my heart
Well, I have sown untidy furrows across my soul, but I am still a coward
Content to see my garden grow so sweet and full of someone else's flowers
Sometimes I can almost feel the power
Sometimes I am so in love with you
Like a little clock that trembles on the edge of the hour
Only ever calling out, ""Cuckoo, cuckoo""

When I called you, you little one, in a bad way
Did you love me, do you spite me?
Time will tell if I can be well
And rise to meet you rightly

While moving across my land
Brandishing themselves like a burning branch
Advance the tallow-colored, walleyed deer
Quiet as gondoliers

While I wait all night for you in California
Watching the fox pick off my goldfish from their sorry, golden state
And I am no longer afraid of anything
Save the life that, here, awaits
I don't belong to anyone
My heart is heavy as an oil drum
And I don't want to be alone
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn
And I have torn my soul apart
From pulling artlessly with fool commands
Some nights I just never go to sleep at all, and I stand
Shaking in my doorway like a sentinel, all alone
Bracing like the bow upon a ship and fully abandoning
Any thought of anywhere but home, my home
Sometimes I can almost feel the power
And I do love you
Is it only timing that has made it such a dark hour
Only ever chiming out, ""Cuckoo""?

Cuckoo, cuckoo-koo
My cuckoo, cuckoo-koo
My cuckoo, cuckoo-koo
My cuckoo, cuckoo-koo

My heart, I wear you down, I know
Gotta think straight, keep a clean plate
Keep from wearing down, if I lose my head
Just where am I going to lay it?
For it has half-ruined me to be hanging around
Here among the daphne blooming out of the big brown
I am native to it, but I'm overgrown
I have choked my roots on the earth as rich as roe
Here, down in California",522
Joanna Newsom,Waltz of the 101st Lightborne,Divers,"I believed they had got what they came for;
I believed our peril was done
On the eve of the last of the Great Wars
After three we had narrowly won
(But the fourth
It was carelessly done.)
I saw his ship in its whistling ascension
As they launched from the Capitol seat–
Swear I saw our mistake
When the clouds draped like a flag
Across the backs of the fleet
Of the Hundred-First Lightborne Elite
As the day is long
So the well runs dry
And we came to see Time is taller
Than Space is wide
And we bade goodbye
To the Great Divide:
Found unlimited simulacreage to colonize!
But there was a time we were lashed to the prow
Of a ship you may board, but not steer
Before You and I ceased to mean Now
And began to mean only Right Here
(to mean Inches and Miles, but not Years);
Before Space has a taste of its limits
And a new sort of coordinate awoke
Making Time just another poor tenant:
Bearing weight, taking fire, trading smokes
In the war between us and our ghosts
(But I saw the Bering Strait and the Golden Gate
In silent suspension of their golden age!
And you can barely tell, if I guard it well
Where I have been, and seen
Pristine, unfelled.)
I had a dream that I walked in the garden
Of Chabot, and those telescope ruins
It was there that I called to my true love
Who was pale as millennial moons
Honey, where did you come by that wound?
When I woke, he was gone
And the War had begun
In eternal return and repeat
Calling, Where in the hell are the rest of your fellow
One Hundred-One Lightborne Elite?
Stormed in the New Highland Light Infantry
Make it stop, my love!
We were wrong to try
Never saw what we could unravel
In traveling light
Nor how the trip debrides–
Like a stack of slides!
All we saw was that Time is taller than Space is wide
That's why we are bound to a round desert island
'neath the sky where our sailors have gone
Have they drowned, in those windy highlands?
Highlands away, my John",372
Joanna Newsom,Sprout and the Bean,The Milk-Eyed Mender,"I slept all day
I woke with distaste
And I railed
And I raved
That the difference between
The sprout and the bean
It is a golden ring
It is a twisted string
And you can ask the counselor
And you can ask the king
And I'll say the same thing
And it's a funny thing
Should we go outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?
And as I said
I slept as though dead
Dreaming seamless dreams
Of lead
When you go away
I am big-boned and fey
In the dust of the day
And in the dirt of the day
And the danger, danger
Drawing near them was a white coat
And the danger, danger
Drawing near them was a broad boat
And the water, water
Running clear beneath a white throat
And the hollow chatter
Of the talking of the tadpoles
Who know th'outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?",163
Joanna Newsom,Does Not Suffice,Have One on Me,"I will pack all my pretty dresses
I will box up my high-heeled shoes
A sparkling ring for every finger
I'll put away and hide from view

Coats of bouclé, jacquard and cashmere
Cartouche and tweed, all silver-shot
And everything that could remind you
Of how easy I was not

I'll tuck away my gilded buttons
I'll bind my silks in shapeless bales
Wrap it all on up in reams of tissue
And then I'll kiss you, sweet, farewell

You saw me rise to our occasion
And so deny the evidence
Caused me to burn and twist and grimace against you
Like something caught on a barbed wire fence

Now you can see me fall back here, redoubled
Full bewildered and amazed
I have gotten into some terrible trouble
Beneath your blank and rinsing gaze

It does not suffice for you to say I am a sweet girl
Or to say you hate to see me sad because of you
It does not suffice to merely lie beside each other
As those who love each other do

I picture you, rising up in the morning
Stretching out on your boundless bed
Beating a clear path to the shower
Scouring yourself red

The tap of hangers swaying in the closet
Unburdened hooks and empty drawers
And everywhere I tried to love you is yours again
And only yours

La-la-la-la...",228
Joanna Newsom,On a Good Day,Have One on Me,"Hey hey hey, the end is near
On a good day, you can see the end from here
But I won't turn back now, though the way is clear
I will stay for the remainder

I saw a life and I called it mine
I saw it drawn so sweet and fine
And I had begun to fill in all the lines
Right down to what we'd name her

Our nature does not change by will
In the winter, 'round the ruined mill
The creek is lying, flat and still
It is water, though it's frozen

So 'cross the years and miles, and through
On a good day, you can feel my love for you
Will you leave me be so that we can stay true
To the path that you have chosen?",133
