Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Red Right Hand,Lovely Creatures: The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"Take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
Where the viaduct looms, like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires
Hey man, you know you're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks
On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

He'll wrap you in his arms, tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams, it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru
They're whispering his name through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand

You don't have no money? He'll get you some
You don't have no car? He'll get you one
You don't have no self-respect, you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy 'cause here he comes
Through the ghettos and the barrio and the Bowery and the slums
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand


You'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
He'll appear out of nowhere but he ain't what he seems
You'll see him in your head, on the TV screen
Hey buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off
He's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
Designed and directed by his red right hand",290
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,O Children,Lovely Creatures: The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"Pass me that lovely little gun
My dear, my darling one
The cleaners are coming one by one
You don't even want to let them start
They are knocking now upon your door
They measure the room, they know the score
They're mopping up the butcher's floor
Of your broken little hearts
Oh-Oh-O Children
Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun
Here, take these before we run away
The keys to the gulag

O Children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Here comes Frank and poor old Jim
They're gathering round with all my friends
We're older now, the light is dim
And you are only just beginning
Oh-Oh-O Children
We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
It's round about and it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings

O Children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice
The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
And they're lining up to inspect you
Oh-Oh-O Children
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost
He's found the answer that we lost
We're all weeping now, weeping because
There ain't nothing we can do to protect you

O children
Lift up your voice, lift up your voice
Children
Rejoice, rejoice

Hey, little train, we are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station
Hey, little train, wait for me!
I once was blind, but now I see
Have you left a seat for me?
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?
Hey little train, wait for me!
I was held in chains, but now I'm free
I'm hanging in there, don't you see?
In this process of elimination
Hey little train, we are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
It's beyond my wildest expectation
Hey little train, we are all jumping on
The train that goes to the Kingdom
We're happy, Ma, we're having fun
And the train ain't even left the station",386
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Where the Wild Roses Grow,Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection (Expanded),"They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

From the first day I saw her, I knew she was the one
She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild

When he knocked on my door and entered the room
My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face

They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

On the second day, I brought her a flower
She was more beautiful than any woman I've seen
I said, ""Do you know where the wild roses grow
So sweet and scarlet and free?""

On the second day, he came with a single red rose
He said, ""Give me your loss and your sorrow""
I nodded my head as I lay on the bed
If I show you the roses, will you follow?

They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day

On the third day, he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a muttered word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist

On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
She lay on the bank, the wind light as a thief
And I kissed her goodbye, said, ""All beauty must die""
And leant down and planted a rose 'tween her teeth

They call me The Wild Rose
But my name was Elisa Day
Why they call me it, I do not know
For my name was Elisa Day
My name was Elisa Day
For my name was Elisa Day",350
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Into My Arms,Lovely Creatures: The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"I don't believe in an interventionist god
But I know, darling, that you do
But if I did, I would kneel down and ask him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Oh, not to touch a hair on your head
Leave you as you are
If he felt he had to direct you
Then direct you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

And I don't believe in the existence of angels
But looking at you I wonder if that's true
But if I did I would summon them together
And ask them to watch over you
Oh, to each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk like Christ in grace and love
And guide you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

But I believe in love
And I know that you do too
And I believe in some kind of path
That we can walk down, me and you
So keep your candles burning
And make her journey bright and pure
That she'll keep returning
Always and evermore

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms",226
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Henry Lee,The Best of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds,"Get down, get down, little Henry Lee
And stay all night with me
You won't find a girl in this damn world

A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

I can't get down and I won't get down

For the girl I have in that merry green land
I love far better than thee

And the wind did howl and the wind did blow

La, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

She leaned herself against a fence
Just for a kiss or two
And with a little pen-knife held in her hand
Well, she plugged him through and through

And the wind did roar and the wind did moan

La, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

Come take him by his lilly-white hands
Come take him by his feet
And throw him in this deep, deep well
Which is more than one hundred feet

And the wind did howl and the wind did blow

La, la-la-la-la
La, la-la-la-lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

Lie there, lie there, little Henry Lee
'Til the flesh drops from your bones

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Jesus Alone,Skeleton Tree,"You fell from the sky
Crash landed in a field
Near the River Adur
Flowers spring from the ground
Lambs burst from the wombs of their mothers
In a hole beneath the bridge
You convalesced, you fashioned masks of twigs and clay
You cried beneath the dripping trees
Ghost song lodged in the throat of a mermaid

With my voice
I am calling you

You're a young man waking
Covered in blood that is not yours
You're a woman in a yellow dress
Surrounded by a charm of hummingbirds
You're a young girl full of forbidden energy
Flickering in the gloom
You're a drug addict lying on your back
In a Tijuana hotel room

With my voice
I am calling you
With my voice
I am calling you

You're an African doctor
Harvesting tear ducts
You believe in God
But you get no special dispensation for this belief now
You're an old man sitting by the fire
You're the mist rolling off the sea
You're a distant memory in the mind of your creator
Don't you see?

With my voice
I am calling you
With my voice
I am calling you
Let us sit together until the moment comes
With my voice
I am calling you
Let us sit together in the dark until the moment comes
With my voice
I am calling you
With my voice
I am calling you
With my voice
I am calling you
With my voice
I am calling you",245
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,The Mercy Seat,Lovely Creatures: The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"It began when they come took me from my home
And put me in Dead Row
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know
And I'll say again
I am not afraid to die

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

And the mercy seat is awaiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
Of an eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die

Interpret signs and catalogue
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog
The walls are bad
Black, bottom kind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say
It seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like, my good hand tattooed E.V.I.L. across its brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of His Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like a moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
So I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied

My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D
'Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that rebel blood

And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this weighing up of truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
But I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is a-melting
And in a way I'm helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway, I saw no proof
And not a motive why
And the mercy seat is a-melting
And I think my blood is boiling
And in a way I'm spoiling
All the fun by all of this consequence and truth
An eye for an eye
And a tooth for a tooth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die
And the mercy seat is awaiting
And I think my head is burning

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,I Need You,Skeleton Tree,"When you're feeling like a lover, nothing really matters anymore
I saw you standing there in the supermarket
With your red dress falling and your eyes are to the ground
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters when the one you love is gone

It's still in me, baby I need you
In my heart, I need you

Cause nothing really matters
I'm standing in the doorway
You're walking 'round to my place
In your red dress, hair hanging down
With your eyes on one, we love the ones we can
Cause nothing really matters when you're standing

Standing
I need you, need you

Cause nothing really matters
We followed the lines in the palms of our hands
You're standing in the supermarket
Nothing, holding hands
In your red dress, falling, falling in, falling in
The long black cars waiting 'round
I will miss you when you're gone
I'll miss you when you're gone away forever
Cause nothing really matters
I thought I knew better, so much better

And I need you
I need you

Cause nothing really matters
Oh the night we wrecked like a train
Purring cars in the pouring rain
Never felt right about it, never again
Cause nothing really matters
Nothing really matters anymore
Not even today, no matter how hard I try
When you're standing in the aisle
And baby, nothing, nothing, nothing

I need, I need, I need you
I need you, I need you
Just breathe, just breathe
I need you",247
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Skeleton Tree,Skeleton Tree,"Sunday morning, skeleton tree
Well, nothing is for free
In the window, a candle
Well, maybe you can see
Fallen leaves thrown across the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white like fire
Nothing is for free

I call out, I call out
Right across the sea
But the echo comes back empty
And nothing is for free

Sunday morning, skeleton tree
Pressed against the sky
A jittery TV
Glowing white like fire

I call out, I call out
Right across the sea
I call out, I call out
Nothing is for free

And it's alright now
And it's alright now
And it's alright now",104
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Rings of Saturn,Skeleton Tree,"Upside down and inside out and on all eights
Like a funnel-web, like a black fly on the ceiling
Skinny, white haunches high and skyward
And her black oily gash crawling backwards across the carpet to smash all over everything
Her wet, black fur against the sun going down
Over the shops and the cars and the crowds in the town

And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she does and this is what she is

Her eyes that look at me through her rainy hair
Are two round holes where the air buckles and rushes in
Her body, moon-blue as a jellyfish
And I'm breathing deep and I'm there and I'm also not there
And spurting ink over the sheets, but she remains, completely unexplained
Or maybe I'm just too tongue-tied to drink it up and swallow back the pain
I thought slavery had been abolished
How come it's gone and reared its ugly head again?

And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
And this is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
This is what she is and this is what she does
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
And this is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly what she is born to be
Then this is what she does and this is what she is

And now she's jumping up with her leaping brain
Stepping over heaps of sleeping children
Disappearing and further up and spinning out again
Up and further up she goes, up and out of the bed
Up and out of the bed and down the hall where she stops for moment and turns and says
""Are you still here?""
And then reaches high and dangles herself like a child's dream from the ring of Saturn",369
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Girl in Amber,Skeleton Tree,"Some go on, some stay behind, some never move at all
Girl in amber, trapped forever, spinning down the hall
Let no part of her go unremembered, clothes across the floor
Girl in amber, long does slumber shuts the bathroom door

The phone, the phone, the phone it rings, it rings, it rings no more
The song, the song, the song it spins since 1984
The phone, the phone, the phone, it rings, the phone, it rings no more
The song, the song, it's been spinning now since 19...

If you want to bleed, just bleed (Ah)
And if you want to bleed, just bleed (Ah)
And if you want to bleed, don't breathe a word
Just step away
And let the world spinning now

You turn, you turn, you kneel, lace up his shoes, your little blue-eyed boy
Take him by his hand, go moving spinning down the hall
I get lucky, I get lucky 'cause I tried again
I knew the world it would stop spinning now since you've been gone
I used to think that when you died you kind of wandered the world
In a slumber till you crumbled, were absorbed into the earth

Well, I don't think that any more
The phone it rings no more
The song, the song it spins, it spins now since 1984
The song, the song, the song it spins, it's been spinning now
And if you'll hold me I will tell you that you know that

If you want to leave, don't breathe (Ah)
And if you want to leave, don't breathe (Ah)
And if you want to leave, don't breathe a word
And let the world turn

The song, the song it spins, the song, it spins, it spins no more
The phone, it rings, it rings
And you won't stay

Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Stagger Lee,Lovely Creatures: The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"It was back in '32 when times were hard
He had a Colt .45 and a deck of cards
Stagger Lee
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old Stetson hat
Had a '28 Ford, he had payments on that

His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, ""Never ever come back no more
Stagger Lee""
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
Stagger Lee
He said ""Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am""
The barkeeper said, ""No, and I don't give a good goddamn""
To Stagger Lee
He said, ""Well bartender, it's so plain to see
I'm the bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee
Mr. Stagger Lee""
Barkeep said, ""Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day
Mr Stagger Lee""
Well ah, those were the last words that the barkeep said
Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head

Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Known to make more money than any bitch in town
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she startin' to flirt
Oh, Stagger Lee
She saw the barkeep, said, ""O God, he can't be dead!""
Stag said, ""Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head!""
She said, ""You ain't look like you scored in quite a time
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime
Mr. Stagger Lee!""
""But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in
Mr. Stagger Lee""
""I'll stay here till Billy Dilly comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy Dilly in his motherfucking ass""
Said Stagger Lee
""I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get to one fat boy's asshole!""
Said Stagger Lee
Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, ""You must be
The mad motherfucker called Stagger Lee""
""I'm Stagger Lee
Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick, because If you don't you're gonna be dead""
Said Stagger Lee

The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well, a girl’s gotta make ends meet
Even down on Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, and over the hill, and out of my mind

I ought to practice what I preach

Who cares what the future brings?

Black road long and I drove and drove

And a hundred black babies running from his genocidal jaw
He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil, man

Driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singing the Higgs Boson Blues
I'm tired, I'm looking for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped in Memphis now
And the Lorraine Motel, it's hot
It's hot - that's why they call it the Hot Spot
I'll take a room with a view
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yeah
And making the hot cots in the flophouse bleed
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops
And the bellhop hops and bops
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove
Everybody bleeding to that Higgs Boson Blues

And if I die tonight
Bury me in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat
That the Caliphate forced on the Jews
Ah, can you feel my heart beat?
Can you feel my heart beat?

And I'm by your side, and I'm holding your hand
Bright horses of wonder springing from your burning hand

The umbilicus was a faucet that fountained rabid blood
And I spun on my wheel like a laboratory rat

I was an electrical storm on the bathroom floor, clutching the bowl
My blood was full of gags and other people's diseases
My monstrous little memory had swallowed me whole
It was the year I officially became the Bride of Jesus

In love, in love, in love you laugh
In love you move, I move
And one more time with feeling
For love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
I saw you in half
And the stars are splashed across the ceiling

Oh, the urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming
I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues
And I had a sudden urge to become someone, someone like you
Who started out with less than anyone I ever knew

In love, in love, I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
I move, you move
And one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
I'm sawn in half
And all the stars are splashed across the ceiling

Oh and oh, you come shyly, softly to the hole to drink
Come as far as the edge of my blood, and then swim
And in the bathroom mirror I see me vomit in the sink
And all through the house we hear the hyena's hymns

Of love, I love, you love, I love, you love
I laugh, you laugh, I move, you move, you move
And one more time with feeling
I love, you love, I laugh, you laugh
We saw each other in half
And all the stars are splashed and splattered across the ceiling",302
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Distant Sky,Skeleton Tree,"Let us go now, my one true love
Call the gasman, cut the power out
We can set out, we can set out for the distant skies
Watch the sun, watch it rising in your eyes

Let us go now, my darling companion
Set out for the distant skies
See the sun, see it rising
See it rising, rising in your eyes

They told us our gods would outlive us
They told us our dreams would outlive us
They told us our gods would outlive us
But they lied

Let us go now, my only companion
Set out for the distant skies
Soon the children will be rising, will be rising
This is not for our eyes",117
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Do You Love Me?,Lovely Creatures: The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,"I found her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'd love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you

She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Yet I seemed so obsolete and small
I found God and all His devils inside her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells in the chapel go jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you

She had a heart full of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come and find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you

All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
Like I love you
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)
(Do you love me?)",462
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Ghosteen,Ghosteen,"This world is beautiful
Held within its stars
I keep it in my heart
The stars are your eyes
I loved them right from the start
A world so beautiful
And I keep it in my heart

A ghosteen dances in my hand
Slowly twirling, twirling all around
A glowing circle in my hand
Dancing, dancing, dancing all around (In my hand)
A ghosteen dances in my hand (In my hand)
Slowly twirling, twirling all around (All around)
A ghosteen dances in my hand (In my hand)
Dancing, dancing, dancing all around (All around)
Here we go

There goes the moonlit man
Got a suitcase in his hand
He's moving on
Down the road
Things tend to fall apart starting with his heart
He kisses you lightly and he leaves
Leaves your sleeping body
Curled and dreaming around your smile, your smile

The three bears watch the TV
They age a lifetime, O' Lord
Mama bear holds the remote
Papa bear, he just floats
And baby bear, he has gone
To the moon in a boat, on a boat

I'm speaking about love now
And how the lights of love go down
You're in the back room washing his clothes
Love's like that, you know, it's like a tidal flow
And the past with its fierce undertow won't ever let us go
Won't ever let you go

If I could move the night I would
And I would turn the world around if I could
There's nothing wrong with loving something
You can't hold in your hand
You're sitting on the edge of the bed
Smoking and shaking your head
Well there's nothing wrong with loving things
That cannot even stand

Well there goes your moony man
With his suitcase in his hand
Well every road is lined with animals
That rise from their blood and walk
Well the moon won't get a wink of sleep
If I stay all night and talk
If I stay all night and talk",330
Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds,Waiting for You,Ghosteen,"All through the night we drove, and the wind caught her hair
And we parked on the beach in the cool evening air
Well, sometimes it's better not to say anything at all
Your body is an anchor, never asked to be free
Just want to stay in the business of making you happy
Well, I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you

A priest runs through the chapel, all the calendars are turning
A Jesus freak on the street says, ""He is returning""
Well, sometimes a little bit of faith can go a long, long way
Your soul is my anchor, I never asked to be freed
Well, sleep now, sleep now, take as long as you need
'Cause I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you to return
To return, to return",158
