Madonna,Like a Prayer,Celebration,"Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mm, mm-mm)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)
It's like a dream to me (Oh, oh-oh-oh yeah)

Madonna,La Isla Bonita,Celebration,"¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Él dijo que te ama

Madonna,Material Girl,Celebration,"Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world
Living in a material world (Material)
Living in a material world

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's all right, you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Madonna,Frozen,Ray of Light,"You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?

Mmm-mmm, give yourself to me
Mmm-mmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same

You always taught me right from wrong
I need your help, daddy, please be strong

He says that he's going to marry me
And we can raise a little family
Maybe we'll be all right
It's a sacrifice

Madonna,Express Yourself,Celebration (Single Disc Edition),"(Hoo!)
(Hoo!)
Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees, so please

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself
(You've got to make him) So you can respect yourself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

Madonna,Ray of Light,Celebration (Single Disc Edition),"Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone, for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying",225
Madonna,Crazy for You,Celebration,"Swaying room, as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two, their bodies become one
I see you through the smoky air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare?
You're so close, but still a world away
What I'm dying to say is that

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye, we need no words at all
Slowly now, we begin to move
Every breath, I'm deeper into you
Soon, we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss
Because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you

Madonna,Don’t Cry for Me Argentina,Evita: The Complete Motion Picture Music Soundtrack,"It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know
That every word is true",246
Madonna,God Control,Madame X (International Deluxe),"Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we've lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do?

To get a decent job, to have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh

Madonna,Dark Ballet,Madame X (International Deluxe),"It's a beautiful life, but I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream, but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy, I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words, 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is
Up in flames

It's a beautiful plan (Hmm), but I'm not concerned (Oh, yeah)
It's a beautiful game (Hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (Shut your mouth), that I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (Hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is—

I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

It's a beautiful life",307
