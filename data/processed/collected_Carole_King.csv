Carole King,You’ve Got a Friend,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"When you're down and troubled
And you need some lovin' care
And nothin', nothin' is goin' right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin'
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knockin' at your door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come runnin', a-runnin', yeah, yeah
To see you again

And take your soul if you let them
Oh, but don't you let them

And you know wherever I am

Carole King,It’s Too Late,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing, or maybe we just stopped trying

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no (No, no, no, no)

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (We can't make it)
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no

(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, dah)

There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it, too?
Still, I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you

But it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (We can't make it now)
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

It's too late, baby
It's too late now, darlin'
It's too late",230
Carole King,Where You Lead,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Loving you the way I do
I only wanna be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'Cause darling, to me that's what you're worth

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely, and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

I always wanted a real home
With flowers on the window sill
But if you want to live in New York City
Honey, you know I will (Yes I will, yes I will)
I never thought I could get satisfaction
From just one man
But if anyone can keep me happy
You're the one who can

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow oh, oh

Carole King,So Far Away,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
How I wish I could
But you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away
Yeah, you're so far away

Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
I sure hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're so far away
Yeah, you're so far away
Hey, you're so far away",209
Carole King,(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I'd have to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
Your love was the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

Oh, when my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

Oh, baby, what you've done to me (what you've done to me)
You make me feel so good inside (good inside)

Carole King,I Feel the Earth Move,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around

Ooh, baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'

Carole King,Will You Love Me Tomorrow?,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (When the night)
Meets the morning sun? (Meets the morning sun?)

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?",115
Carole King,Tapestry,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold

Once amid the soft silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow-green on either side

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty

Soon within my tapestry along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure gray and ghostly beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black
Now my tapestry's unraveling, he's come to take me back
He's come to take me back",202
Carole King,Beautiful,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

Waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers-by
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
And they don't see it showing, why do I?

You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

I have often asked myself the reason for the sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try

You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful as you feel",199
Carole King,Where You Lead I Will Follow,Love Makes The World: Deluxe Edition,"Loving you the way I do

Carole King,Home Again,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Sometimes I wonder if I'm ever gonna make it home again
It's so far and out of sight
I really need someone to talk to, and nobody else

Carole King,Now and Forever,Colour of Your Dreams,"Now and forever
You are a part of me
And the memory cuts like a knife
Didn't we find the ecstasy?
Didn't we share the daylight
When you walked into my life?
Now and forever
I'll remember
All the promises still unbroken
And think about all the words between us
That never needed to be spoken

We had a moment
Just one moment
That will last beyond a dream
Beyond a lifetime
We are the lucky ones
Some people never get to do
All we got to do
Now and forever
I will always think of you

Didn't we come together?
Didn't we live together?
Didn't we cry together?
Didn't we play together?
Didn't we love together?
And together we lit up the world

I miss the tears
I miss the laughter
I miss the day we met and all that followed after
Sometimes I wish I could always be with you
The way we used to do
Oh, now and forever
I will always think of you
Now and forever
I will always be with you (Oh whoa)",179
Carole King,Smackwater Jack,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Now, Smackwater Jack, he bought a shotgun
'Cause he was in the mood for a little confrontation
He just let it all hang loose
He didn't think about the noose
He couldn't take no more abuse
So he shot down the congregation

You can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand
Shotgun

Now Big Jim the Chief stood for law and order
He called for the guard to come and surround the border
Now, from his bulldog mouth
As he led the posse south
Came the cry, ""We got to ride to clean up the streets
For our wives and our daughters"" (Oh, no, no)

You can't talk to a man
When he don't wanna understand
Oh, no, no, no, no

The account of the capture wasn't in the papers
But you know, they hanged ole Smack right then instead of later
You know, the people were quite pleased
'Cause the outlaw had been seized
And, on the whole, it was a very good year
For the undertaker

You know, you know, you can't talk to a man
With a shotgun in his hand
A shotgun in his hand

(Smackwater Jack, yeah)
Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun
Yeah, Smackwater Jack bought a shotgun

Carole King,Way Over Yonder,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Way over yonder

Where I can find shelter
From a-hunger and cold

Is so easily found
Way over yonder

I know, when I get there
The first thing I'll see
Is the sun shining golden (Sun shining golden)
Shining right down on me

Then trouble's gonna lose me
Worry leave me behind
And I'll stand up proudly
In true peace of mind
Talking 'bout a, talking 'bout a

Way over yonder
Is a place I have seen
In a garden of wisdom
From some long ago dream

I'll find my way
To the land where the honey runs
In rivers each day

But you can make the times to come better than the rest
I know you will be honest if you can't always be kind

Carole King,Up On the Roof,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustle and crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Oh, let's go up on the roof


At night the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
Keep on telling you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
So if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two, up on the roof

Up on the roof, everything is all right
Up on the roof, oh, come on, baby
Up on the roof
Everything is all right
Up on the roof",201
Carole King,Jazzman,A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976,"Lift me, won't you lift me
Above the old routine?
Make it nice, play it clean, jazzman

When the jazzman's testifyin'
A faithless man believes
He can sing you into paradise
Or bring you to your knees
It's a gospel kind of feelin'
A touch of Georgia slide
A song of pure revival
And a style that's sanctified

Jazzman, take my blues away
Make my pain the same as yours
With every change you play
Jazzman, oh jazzman

When the jazzman's signifyin'
And the band is windin' low
It's the late night side of mornin'
In the darkness of his soul
He can fill a room with sadness
As he fills his horn with tears
He can cry like a fallen angel
When risin' time is near

Jazzman, take my blues away
Make my pain the same as yours
With every change you play

Oh lift me, won't you lift me
With every turnaround?
Play it sweetly, take me down, oh jazzman",162

My snowman's anniversary
With cake for him and soup for me!
Happy once, happy twice
Happy chicken soup with rice

And spills my soup upon the floor
It laps it up and roars for more
Blowing once, blowing twice
Blowing chicken soup with rice

In April I will go away
To far off Spain or old Bombay
And dream about hot soup all day
Oh my once, oh my twice
Oh my, oh, chicken soup with rice

In May I truly think it best
To be a robin lightly dressed
Concocting soup inside my nest
Mix it once, mix it twice
Mix that chicken soup with rice

In June I saw a charming group
Of roses all begin to droop
I pepped them up with chicken soup!
Sprinkle once, sprinkle twice
Sprinkle chicken soup with rice

In July I'll take a peep
Into the cool and fishy deep
Where chicken soup is selling cheap
Selling once, ah, selling twice
Selling chicken soup with rice

In August it will be so hot
I will become a cooking pot
Cooking soup of course—why not?
Cooking once, cooking twice
Cooking chicken soup with rice

In September, for a while (In September, for a while)
I will ride a crocodile (I will ride a crocodile)
Down the chicken soup-y Nile
Paddle once, paddle twice
Paddle chicken soup with rice

In October I'll be host
To witches, goblins and a ghost
I'll serve them chicken soup on toast
Whoopy once, whoopy twice
Whoopy chicken soup with rice

In November's gusty gale I will flop my flippy tail
And spout hot soup—I'll be a whale!
Spouting once, spouting twice
Spouting chicken soup with rice

In December I will be
A baubled, bangled Christmas tree
(Baubled, bangled Christmas tree)
With soup bowls draped all over me
Merry once, merry twice
Merry chicken soup with

Merry chicken soup with rice

I told you once, I told you twice

For eating chicken soup
Eating chicken soup with rice
