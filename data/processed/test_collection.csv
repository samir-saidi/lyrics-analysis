Joanna Newsom,Only Skin,Ys,"And there was a booming above you
That night black airplanes flew over the sea
And they were lowing and shifting like
Beached whales
Shelled snails
As you strained and you squinted to see
The retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry
You froze in your sand shoal
Prayed for your poor soul;
Sky was a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl
And when the bread broke —
Fell in bricks of wet smoke —
My sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke
Then there was a silence you took to mean something:
Mean, Run, sing
For alive you will evermore be
And the plague of the greasy black engines a-skulking
Has gone east
While you’re left to explain them to me —
Released
From their hairless and blind cavalry
With your hands in your pockets
Stubbily running
To where I’m unfresh
Undressed and yawning —
Well, what is this craziness?
This crazy talking?
You caught some small death
When you were sleepwalking
It was a dark dream, darlin;
It’s over
The firebreather is beneath the clover
Beneath his breathing there is cold clay, forever:
A toothless hound-dog choking on a feather
But I took my fishing pole (fearing your fever)
Down to the swimming hole, where there grows a bitter herb
That blooms but one day a year, by the riverside —
I’d bring it here:
Apply it gently
To the love you’ve lent me
While the river was twisting and braiding, the bait bobbed
And the string sobbed
As it cut through the hustling breeze
And I watched how the water was kneading so neatly
Gone treacly
Nearly slowed to a stop in this heat;
In a frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath
Press on me
We are restless things
Webs of seaweed are swaddling
You call upon the dusk of the
Musk of a squid:
Shot full of ink, until you sink into your crib
Rowing along, among the reeds, among the rushes
I heard your song, before my heart had time to hush it!
Smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened
Smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking
And when the fire moves away
Fire moves away, son
Why would you say
I was the last one?
Scrape your knee: it is only skin
Makes the sound of violins
And when I cut your hair, and leave the birds all of the trimmings
I am the happiest woman among all women
And the shallow water stretches as far as I can see
Knee deep, trudging along —
The seagull weeps ‘so long’ —
I’m humming a threshing song —
Until the night is over, hold on
Hold on;
Hold your horses back from the fickle dawn
I have got some business out at the edge of town
Candy weighing both of my pockets down
Till I can hardly stay afloat, from the weight of them
(and knowing how the commonfolk condemn
What it is I do, to you, to keep you warm:
Being a woman. Being a woman.)
But always up the mountainside you’re clambering
Groping blindly, hungry for anything;
Picking through your pocket linings —
Well, what is this?
Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus?
I see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain
Little sister, he will be back again
I have washed a thousand spiders down the drain
Spiders’ ghosts hang, soaked and dangling
Silently from all the blooming cherry trees
In tiny nooses, safe from everyone —
Nothing but a nuisance; gone now, dead and done —
Be a woman. Be a woman
Though we felt the spray of the waves
We decided to stay, 'till the tide rose too far
We weren’t afraid, 'cause we know what you are;
And you know that we know what you are
Awful atoll —
O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow!
Bawl bellow:
Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow
Toddle and roll;
Teethe an impalpable bit of leather
While yarrow, heather and hollyhock
Awkwardly molt along the shore
Are you mine?
My heart?
Mine anymore?
Stay with me for awhile
That’s an awfully real gun
And though life will lay you down
As the lightning has lately done
Failing this, failing this
Follow me, my sweetest friend
To see what you anointed
In pointing your gun there
Lay it down! Nice and slow!
There is nowhere to go
Save up;
Up where the light, undiluted, is
Weaving, in a drunk dream
At the sight of my baby, out back:
Back on the patio
Watching the bats bring night in
— while, elsewhere
Estuaries of wax-white
Wend, endlessly, towards seashores unmapped
Last week, our picture window
Produced a half-word
Heavy and hollow
Hit by a brown bird
We stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake
And pant and labor over every intake
I said a sort of prayer for some rare grace
Then thought I ought to take her to a higher place
Said, “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you
And though you die, bird, you will have a fine view.”
Then in my hot hand, she slumped her sick weight
We tramped through the poison oak, heartbroke and inchoate
The dogs were snapping and you cuffed their collars
While I climbed the treehouse. Then how I hollered!
Where she’d lain, as still as a stone, in my palm, for a lifetime or two;
Then saw the treetops, cocked her head, and up and flew
(While back in the world that moves, often, according to
The hoarding of these clues)
Dogs still run roughly around
Little tufts of finch-down
And the cities we passed were a flickering wasteland,
But his hand, in my hand, made them hale and harmless
While down in the lowlands, the crops are all coming;
We have everything
Life is thundering blissful towards death
In a stampede
Of his fumbling green gentleness
You stopped by;
I was all alive
In my doorway, we shucked and jived
And when you wept, I was gone;
See, I got gone when I got wise
But I can’t with certainty say we survived
Then down and down
And down and down
And down and deeper
Stoke, without sound
The blameless flames
You endless sleeper
Through fire below
And fire above
And fire within
Sleep through the things that couldn’t have been
If you hadn’t have been
And when the fire moves away
Fire moves away, son
Why would you say
I was the last one?
All my bones, they are gone, gone, gone
Take my bones, I don’t need none
Cold, cold cupboard, lord, nothing to chew on!
Suck all day on a cherry stone
Dig a little hole not three inches round —
Spit your pit in a hole in the ground
Weep upon the spot for the starving of me!
Till up grows a fine young cherry tree
When the bough breaks, what’ll you make for me?
A little willow cabin to rest on your knee
What’ll I do with a trinket such as this?
Think of your woman, who’s gone to the west
But I’m starving and freezing in my measly old bed!
Then I’ll crawl across the salt flats, to stroke your sweet head
Come across the desert with no shoes on!
I love you truly
Or I love no-one
Fire moves away. Fire moves away, son
Why would you say that I was the last one, last one?
Clear the room! There’s a fire, a fire, a fire
Get going
And I’m going to be right behind you
And if the love of a woman or two, dear
Could move you to such heights
Then all I can do
Is do, my darling, right by you",1287
Joanna Newsom,Sapokanikan,Divers,"The cause is Ozymandian
The map of Sapokanikan
Is sanded and bevelled
The land lone and levelled
By some unrecorded and powerful hand
Which plays along the monument
And drums upon a plastic bag
The brave-men-and-women-so-dear-to-God-
And-famous-to-all-of-the-ages rag
Sing: Do you love me?
Will you remember?
The snow falls above me
The renderer renders:
The event is in the hand of God
Beneath a patch of grass, her
Bones the old Dutch master hid
While elsewhere Tobias
And the angel disguise
What the scholars surmise was a mother and kid
Interred with other daughters
In dirt in other potter's fields
Above them, parades
Mark the passing of days
Through parks where pale colonnades arch in marble and steel
Where all of the twenty-thousand attending your footfall
And the cause that they died for are lost in the idling bird calls
And the records they left are cryptic at best
Lost in obsolescence
The text will not yield, nor x-ray reveal
With any fluorescence
Where the hand of the master begins and ends
I fell, I tried to do well but I won't be
Will you tell the one that I loved to remember and hold me
I call and call for the doctor
But the snow swallows me whole with ol' Florry Walker
And the event lives only in print
He said:
""It's alright, and it's all over now""
And boarded the plane
His belt unfastened
The boy was known to show unusual daring
And, called a ""boy""
This alderman, confounding Tammany Hall
In whose employ King Tamanend himself preceded John’s fall
So we all raise a standard
To which the wise and honest soul may repair
To which a hunter
A hundred years from now, may look and despair
And see with wonder
The tributes we have left to rust in the park
Swearing that our hair stood on end
To see John Purroy Mitchel depart
For the Western Front
Where work might count
All exeunt! All go out!
Await the hunter, to decipher the stone
(and what lies under, now)
The city is gone
Look and despair
Look and despair",352
Joanna Newsom,Emily,Ys,"The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow
Set to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh
Little while later the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow
Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window?
There is a rusty light on the pines tonight;
Sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow, into the
Bones of the birches, and the spires of the churches, jutting out from the shadows;
The yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks, and the bale, and the barrow—
And everything sloped, like it was dragged from a rope, in the mouth of the south below
We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey
We thought our very hearts would up and melt away
From that snow in the nighttime
Just going and going
And the stirring of wind chimes
In the morning
In the morning
Helps me find my way back in
From the place where I have been—
And, Emily, I saw you last night by the river
I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water—
Frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever
In a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky'd been breathing on a mirror
Anyhow, I sat by your side, by the water
You taught me the names of the stars overhead, that I wrote down in my ledger—
Though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades, loosed in December
I promised you I'd set them to verse so I'd always remember

That the meteorite is the source of the light
And the meteor's just what we see;
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee
And the meteorite’s just what causes the light
And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;
And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void, that lies quiet in offering to thee

You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I'm in;
Threw the windows wide and cried, ""Amen! Amen! Amen!""
The whole world stopped to hear you hollering
You looked down, and saw, now, what was happening:
The lines are fading in my kingdom
(Though I have never known the way to border them in);
So the muddy mouths of baboons and sows, and the grouse, and the horse, and the hen
Grope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen
And the mail is late, and the great estates are not lit from within
The talk in town's becoming downright sickening
In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare
I've seen your bravery, and I will follow you there
And row through the nighttime
So healthy
Gone healthy all of a sudden
In search of a midwife
Who can help me
Who can help me
Help me find my way back in
And there are worries where I've been
And say, say, say, in the lee of the bay
Don't be bothered
Leave your troubles here
Where the tugboats shear the water from the water
(Flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper)
Emily, they'll follow your lead by the letter
And I make this claim, and I'm not ashamed to say I knew you better
What they've seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter
Let us go! Though we know it's a hopeless endeavor
The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined, and hold us close forever
Though there is nothing would help me come to grips with
A sky that is gaping and yawning
There is a song I woke with on my lips
As you sailed your great ship towards the morning
Come on home. The poppies are all grown knee-deep by now
Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow
Peonies nod in the breeze
And while they wetly bow
With hydrocephalitic listlessness
Ants mop up their brow
And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour;
The butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours
And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines—
Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines
Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight
The way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light
Squint skyward and listen—
Loving him, we move within his borders:
Just asterisms in the stars' set order
We could stand for a century
Staring
With our heads cocked
In the broad daylight at this thing:
Joy
Landlocked in bodies that don’t keep—
Dumbstruck with the sweetness of being
Till we don’t be
Told: take this
Eat this

Told: the meteorite is the source of the light
And the meteor's just what we see;
And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee
And the meteorite’s just what causes the light
And the meteor’s how it’s perceived;
And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee",848
