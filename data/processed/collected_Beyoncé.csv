Beyoncé,Drunk in Love,BEYONCÉ (Platinum Edition),"I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you (Ah)

We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', ""How the hell did this shit happen?"", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this, swerve, surfin' all in this good-good (Ha-ha-ha)

We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', ""How the hell did this shit happen?"", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
[Chorus: Beyoncé & 
JAY-Z
]
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love (
I'm nice right now, hold up
)

That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae,"" said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae""
I'm nice
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight
We sex again in the mornin'
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in
[Chorus: Beyoncé, 
Beyoncé & JAY-Z
]
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin' watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night

Beyoncé,Halo,I AM... SASHA FIERCE (Platinum Edition),"Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'

Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

Give me somethin'

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)
Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin', babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say, ""Speed it up,"" I just go slower
High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he want a smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up

Now my mascara runnin', red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Oh, there, daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down

Hey

Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blastin'
He like to call me ""Peaches"" when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we'll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdroppin', tryin' not to crash

Oh, there, daddy, daddy, now you rip my fur
Oh, baby, baby be sweatin' off my hair

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Beyoncé,If I Were a Boy,I AM... SASHA FIERCE (Platinum Edition),"If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted, then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh-ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed

But you're just a boy",309
Beyoncé,Mine,BEYONCÉ (Platinum Edition),"I've been watchin' for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh

Are we gonna even make it? Oh

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?

Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down

You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five-star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up

But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy

So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

How I missed you, my love",433
Beyoncé,Pray You Catch Me,Lemonade,"You can taste the dishonesty
It's all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray you catch me

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Pray to catch you whispering
I pray you catch me listening
I pray to catch you whispering (Whisper, whisper)
I pray you catch me (Whisper, whisper)

We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (
C-Candy on the ground
)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (
Dum-da-dee-da
)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (
Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da
)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (
Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away, oh
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that way",140
