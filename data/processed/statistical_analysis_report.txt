RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. Do pop artists exhibit different lexical complexity than alternative artists?
2. Which specific complexity metrics show the strongest differences?
3. Are different types of complexity related within songs?
4. Are there significant differences in readability between groups?

METHODOLOGY

Data Source: Genius.com API
Artists Analyzed:
  - Alternative: Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Joanna Newsom, Joni Mitchell, Sufjan Stevens, Fiona Apple, Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Carole King
  - Pop: Michael Jackson, Taylor Swift, The Beatles, Prince, Beyoncé, Madonna, Britney Spears, Adele, Whitney Houston, Elton John

Complexity Metrics Calculated:
1. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
2. Type-Token Ratio (Lexical Diversity)
3. Gunning Fog Index
4. Coleman-Liau Index
5. Automated Readability Index
6. Average Sentence Length

Statistical Tests Applied:
- Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
- Levene's test for homogeneity of variance
- Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for group comparisons
- Pearson and Spearman correlations
- Effect sizes (Cohen's d or Rank-biserial correlation)

INTERPRETATION OF RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. Do pop artists exhibit different lexical complexity than alternative artists?
   2/4 metrics show significant differences:
   - Type Token Ratio: pop > alt (p=0.0000)
   - Coleman Liau: pop > alt (p=0.0352)

2. Which specific complexity metrics show the strongest differences?
   Ranked by effect size (strongest first):
   - Type Token Ratio: Rank-biserial r = 0.49 (medium effect)
   - Coleman Liau: Rank-biserial r = 0.12 (small effect)
   - Flesch Kincaid Grade: Rank-biserial r = -0.01 (small effect)
   - Gunning Fog: Rank-biserial r = -0.01 (small effect)

3. Are different types of complexity related within songs?
   Key correlations between metrics:
   - Flesch Kincaid Grade & Gunning Fog: r = 1.00 (strong positive correlation)
   - Flesch Kincaid Grade & Type Token Ratio: r = -0.31 (moderate negative correlation)
   - Type Token Ratio & Gunning Fog: r = -0.31 (moderate negative correlation)

4. Are there significant differences in readability between groups?
   1/3 readability metrics differ:
   - Coleman Liau: pop > alt (p=0.0352)


CONCLUSIONS

Based on the analysis of 398 songs:

Significant differences found:
   - Type Token Ratio: pop > alt (medium effect)
   - Coleman Liau: pop > alt (small effect)


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

1. Increase sample size for more statistical power
2. Include more artists in each genre category
3. Analyze trends over time within artists' careers
4. Include additional linguistic features (syntactic complexity, semantic analysis)
5. Compare with broader music genres for context
