Joni Mitchell,Big Yellow Taxi,Dreamland,"They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot",234
Joni Mitchell,Both Sides Now,Hits,"Rows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
And you leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions that I recall
I really don't know, I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh, but now old friends are acting strange
And they shake their heads, and they tell me that I've changed
Well, something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all


I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life, I really don't know life at all",275
Joni Mitchell,A Case of You,"Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced","Just before our love got lost you said
""I am as constant as a northern star""
And I said, ""Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar""

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time you told me, you said
""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman, she had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, ""Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed""

Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet",280
Joni Mitchell,California,Dreamland,"Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't wanna stay here, it's too old and cold
And settled in its ways here

Oh, but California
California, I'm coming home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California, I'm coming home

I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh, the rogue, the red-red rogue
He cooked good omelets and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there
But my heart cried out for you

California
Oh, California, I'm coming home
Oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home

Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues

So I bought me a ticket, I caught a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading 
Rolling Stone
Reading Vogue, they said, ""How long can you hang around?""
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown
Then I'm going home

To California
California, I'm coming home
Oh, will you take me as I am?
Strung out on another man
California, I'm coming home

Oh, it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes

Oh, will you take me as I am?
Will you take me as I am?
Will you?
Will you take me as I am?
Hmm-mm, mmm-mm
Take me as I am
Oh, will you take me as I am?",339
Joni Mitchell,River,"Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced","It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on",231
Joni Mitchell,Blue,"Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced","Blue, songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

Hey, Blue, there is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

Well, there's so many sinking now
You gotta keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs

Everybody's saying that
Hell's the hippest way to go
Well, I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it, though
Blue, I love you

Blue, here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me",121
Joni Mitchell,Little Green,Blue,"Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she will answer to
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her
Call her green for the children who've made her
Little green, be a gypsy dancer

He went to California
Hearing that everything's warmer there
So you write him a letter and say, ""Her eyes are blue""
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Little green, he's a non-conformer

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you are sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
You're sad and you're sorry, but you're not ashamed
Little green, have a happy ending

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow",197
Joni Mitchell,All I Want,"Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced","I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be?
Oh, I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh, I love you when I forget about me
I wanna be strong, I wanna laugh along
I wanna belong to the living
Alive, alive, I wanna get up and jive
I wanna wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want, do you want, do you wanna dance with me, baby?
Do you wanna take a chance
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me, baby?
Well, come on

All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
I wanna renew you again and again
Applause, applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses, my mind seesaws
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me, baby?
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh, the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling and it undoes all the joy that could be
I wanna have fun, I wanna shine like the sun
Wanna be the one that you wanna see
I wanna knit you a sweater
Wanna write you a love letter
I wanna make you feel better
I wanna make you feel free
Wanna make you feel free
I wanna make you feel free",292
Joni Mitchell,The Circle Game,Dreamland,"Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times 'round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like ""when you're older"" must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
And they tell him, ""Take your time, it won't be long now
'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down""

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game

So, the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons, they go 'round and 'round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return, we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game
And go 'round and 'round and 'round
In the circle game",327
Joni Mitchell,Carey,"Love Has Many Faces: A Quartet, A Ballet, Waiting to Be Danced","The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here, Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy
I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen
And my fancy French cologne

Oh, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you fine

Come on down to the Mermaid Café
And I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing
And smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But I like you
I like you, I like you, I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano
And put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy
But I like you

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Café
Have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy
But you're out of sight",329
