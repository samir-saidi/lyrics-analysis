Tori Amos,Cornflake Girl,A Piano: The Collection,"Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us a yo-heave-ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time

This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love

This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

Never was a cornflake girl

Tori Amos,Winter,A Piano: The Collection,"Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
I put my hand in my father's glove
I run off where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown
I hear a voice: ""You must learn to stand up
For yourself, cause I can't always be around""

He says:
""When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear""

Boys get discovered as winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was
Mirror mirror, where's the crystal palace?
But I only can see myself
Skating around the truth who I am
But I know, Dad, the ice is getting thin

""When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear""

Hair is grey and the fires are burning
So many dreams on the shelf
You say ""I wanted you to be proud of me""
I always wanted that myself

""When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses have gone ahead
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear""

Never change
All the white horses, ah
Hmm",324
Tori Amos,Silent All These Years,A Piano: The Collection,"Excuse me, but can I be you for a while?
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the Antichrist in the kitchen yelling at me again
Yeah, I can hear that
Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say, you know but nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Yeah, I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these years

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you?
My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?

'Cause what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been
Here, silent all these

Years go by, will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears
Till finally, there is nothing left?
One more casualty, you know
We're too easy, easy, easy

Well, I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
And it's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand
Yeah, I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey, but I don't care cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice
I hear my voice and it's been
Here, silent all these years

I've been here
Silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these years",392
Tori Amos,A Sorta Fairytale,A Piano: The Collection,"On my way up north, up on the Ventura
I pulled back the hood and I was talking to you
And I knew then it would be a lifelong thing
But I didn't know that we, we could break a silver lining

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
A sorta fairytale with you

Things you said that day, up on the 101
The girl had come undone, I tried to downplay it
With a bet about us, you said that you'd take it
As long as I could, I could not erase it

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
A sorta fairytale with you

And I ride alongside
And I rode alongside you then
And I rode alongside till you lost me there in the open road
And I rode alongside till the honey spread itself so thin
For me to break your bread, for me to take your word
I had to steal it

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
I could pick back up whenever I feel

Down New Mexico way, something about the open road
I knew that he was looking for some Indian blood
And find a little in you find a little in me
We may be on this road but
We're just impostors in this country, you know
So we go along and we said we'd fake it
Feel better with Oliver Stone
Till I almost smacked him, seemed right that night and
I don't know what takes hold out there in the desert cold
These guys think they must try and just get over on us

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you (A sorta fairytale with you)
A sorta fairytale with you

And I was riding by, riding alongside
For a while till you lost me
And I was riding by, riding along till you lost me
Till you lost me in the rearview
You lost me, I said. yeah

Way up north I took my day
All in all, was a pretty nice day
And I, I put the hood right back where
You could taste heaven perfectly
Feel out the summer breeze
Didn't know when we'd be back
And I, I don't, didn't think we'd end up like
Like this",436
Tori Amos,Crucify,Little Earthquakes (Deluxe Edition),"Every finger in the room
Is pointing at me
I wanna spit in their faces
Then I get afraid of what that could bring
I got a bowling ball in my stomach
I got a desert in my mouth
Figures that my courage
Would choose to sell out now

I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Just what God needs: one more victim

Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself, nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
And my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in
Chains, oh oh oh
Chains, oh oh oh

Got a kick for a dog
Begging for love
I gotta have my suffering
So that I can have my cross
I know a cat named Easter
He says, ""Will you ever learn?
You're just an empty cage girl
If you kill the bird""

I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Got enough guilt to start my own religion

Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself, nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself, every day
I crucify myself
And my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in
Chains, oh oh oh
Chains, oh oh oh

Please be
Save me
I cry

Looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
I've been raising up my hands, drive another nail in
Where are those angels when you need them?

Why do we crucify ourselves every day?
I crucify myself, nothing I do is good enough for you
I crucify myself every day
I crucify myself
And my heart is sick of being
I said my heart is sick of being in
Chains, oh oh oh
Chains

Why do we, in chains (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
Crucify ourselves, every day (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
Oh, chains, oh yeah (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
In chains (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
Never going back again, no (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
To crucify myself again, you know (Why do we crucify ourselves?)
Never going back again to crucify myself (Why do we crucify ourselves?)

Tori Amos,Me and a Gun,A Piano: The Collection,"5 a.m., Friday morning
Thursday night, far from sleep
I'm still up and driving
Can't go home obviously
So I'll just change direction
'Cause they'll soon know where I live
And I wanna live
Got a full tank and some chips

It was me and a gun
And a man on my back
And I sang ""Holy holy""
As he buttoned down his pants

You can laugh, it's kind of funny
Things you think at times like these
Like I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this
Yes, I wore a slinky red thing
Does that mean I should spread
For you, your friends
Your father, Mr. Ed?

Was me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

And I know what this means
Me and Jesus a few years back
Used to hang and he said
""It's your choice babe, just remember
I don't think you'll be back
In three days time, so you choose well""
Tell me what's right, is it my right
To be on my stomach of Fred's Seville

Was me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

And do you know Carolina
Where the biscuits are soft and sweet?
These things go through your head
When there's a man on your back
And you're pushed flat on your stomach
It's not a classic Cadillac

Me and a gun
And a man on my back
But I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this

I haven't seen Barbados
So I must get out of this",282

Caught a lightweight lightning seed
Boys on my left side, boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here

From the girl zone

Building (Inanna)
Tumbling down (Inanna)
Didn't know our love was so small (Inanna)
Couldn't stand it all (Inanna)

Right on time

Called my name
There's no way in
Use that fame
Rent your wife and kids today
Yeah, maybe she will
I said maybe she will

Caught a lite sneeze, dreamed a little dream
Made my own pretty hate machine
Boys on my left side, boys on my right side
Boys in the middle and you're not here
Boys in their dresses and you're not here

I need a big loan
From the girl zone

Tori Amos,Precious Things,A Piano: The Collection,"So I ran faster
But it caught me here
Yes, my loyalties turned
Like my ankle
In the seventh grade
Running after Billy
Running after the rain

These precious things
Let them bleed, let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break their hold on me

He said, ""You're really an ugly girl
But I like the way you play""
And I died
But I thanked him
Can you believe that?
Sick, sick, holding on to his picture
Dressing up every day
I wanna smash the faces
Of those beautiful boys
Those Christian boys
So, you can make me cum
That doesn't make you Jesus

These precious things
Let them bleed, let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break their hold on me

I remember, yes
In my peach party dress
No one dared
No one cared to tell me
Where the pretty girls are
Those demigods
With their nine-inch nails
And little fascist panties
Tucked inside the heart of every nice girl

These precious things
Let them bleed, let them wash away
These precious things
Let them break, let them wash away
These, these precious things
Let them bleed, now, let them wash away
These, these precious things
Let them break their hold on me

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
When he sucks you deep, yes
Sometimes you’re nothing but meat",235
Tori Amos,Raspberry Swirl,From the Choir Girl Hotel,"Hey, hey, hey, let's go
I am not your señorita
I am not from your tribe
In the garden, in the garden I did no crime

I am not your señorita
I am not from your tribe
If you want inside her well
Boy, you better make her raspberry swirl

Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man

Hey, hey, hey, let's go
I am not your señorita
I don’t aim so high
In my heart, in my heart, I did no crime
If you want inside her well
Boy, you better make her raspberry swirl

Raspberry swirl, let's go
Raspberry swirl

Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)

Everybody knows I'm her man

Raspberry swirl, let's go
Raspberry swirl, you want inside her world
(And she swirls and she swirls and she swirls)
Yes, let's go, raspberry swirl

Let's go, raspberry swirl

Tori Amos,Girl,A Piano: The Collection,"From in the shadow she calls
And in the shadow she finds a way, finds a way
And in the shadow she crawls
Clutching her faded photograph
My image under her thumb
Yes, with a message for my heart
Yes, with a message for my heart

She's been everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own

Hey, and in the doorway they stay
And laugh as violins fill with water
Screams from the bluebells can't make them go away
Well I'm not seventeen
But I've cuts on my knees
Falling down as the winter
Takes one more cherry tree

She's been everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own

Everyone else's girl
(Everyone else's girl)
Maybe one day she'll be her own
(One day she'll be her own)
Everyone else's girl
(Rushin' rivers thread so thin, limitation)
Maybe one day she'll be her own
(Dreams with the flying pigs turbid blue)
Oh, everyone else's girl
(And the drugstore's too safe)
Maybe one day she'll be her own
(In their coats and in their do's)
Oh, everyone else's girl
(Yeah, smother in our hearts, a pillow to my dots)
Maybe one day, maybe one day
One day she'll be her own

And in the mist, there she rides
And castles are burning in my heart
And as I twist I hold tight
And I ride to work every morning wondering why
""Sit in the chair and be good now""
And become all that they told you
The white coats enter her room and I'm calling my baby
Calling my baby, calling my baby, calling

Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own",317
Tori Amos,Hey Jupiter,Boys for Pele,"No one’s picking up the phone, guess it’s me and me
And this little masochist, she’s ready to confess
All the things that I never thought that she could feel

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
And I thought I wouldn’t have to be with you, something new

Sometimes I breathe you in
And I know you know
And sometimes you take a swim
Found your writing on my wall
If my heart’s soaking wet
Boy, your boots can leave a mess

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
And I thought you wouldn’t have to keep with me, hiding

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, yes

Thought I knew myself so well
All the dolls I had
Took my leather off the shelf
Your apocalypse was fab
For a girl who couldn’t choose
Between the shower or the bath

And I thought I wouldn’t have to be with you, a magazine

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, yes
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, yes

No one’s picking up the phone
Guess it’s clear, he’s gone
And this little masochist
Is lifting up her dress
Guess I thought I could never feel
The things I feel

Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you gay, are you blue?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Hey Jupiter, nothing’s been the same
So are you safe, now we’re through?
Thought we both could use a friend to run to
Hey Jupiter",269
Tori Amos,Tear in Your Hand,A Piano: The Collection,"All the world just stopped now
So you say you don't wanna stay together anymore
Let me take a deep breath, babe
If you need me, me and Neil'll be
Hanging out with the Dream King
Neil said ""Hi"", by the way
I don't believe you're leaving cause me and Charles
Manson like the same ice cream
I think it's that girl

And I think they're pieces of me you've never seen
Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen, well

All the world is all I am
The black of the blackest ocean
And the tear in your hand
All the world is
Dangling, dangling, dangling for me, darling
You don't know the power that you have
With that tear in your hand
Tear in your hand

Maybe I ain't used to
Maybe's smashing in a cold room
Cutting my hands up
Every time I touch you
Maybe, maybe it's time to wave goodbye now
Time to wave goodbye now

Caught a ride with the moon
I know I know you well
Well, better than I used to
Haze all clouded up my mind
In the daze of why it could've never been
So you say and I say you know you're full of wish
And your ""Baby, baby, baby, babies""

I tell you they're pieces of me you've never seen
Maybe she's just pieces of me you've never seen, well

All the world is all I am
The black of the blackest ocean
And the tear in your hand
All the world is
Dangling, dangling, dangling for me darling
You don't know the power that you have
With that tear in your hand
Tear in your hand
With that tear in your hand",286
