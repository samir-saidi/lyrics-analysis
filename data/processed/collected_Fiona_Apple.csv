Fiona Apple,Paper Bag,iTunes Originals: Fiona Apple,"I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold, 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works
When it costs too much to love

And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine, and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on, put a little love here in my void,""
He said ""It's all in your head,""
And I said, ""So's everything,"" but he didn't get it
I thought he was a man, but he was just a little boy

Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold, 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works
When it costs too much to love
Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold, because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works me
When it costs too much to love
Oh, hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
Because I know that I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold, because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving, it works
When it costs too much to love, hmm, hmm",373
Fiona Apple,Criminal,Tidal,"I've been a bad, bad girl
I've been careless with a delicate man
And it's a sad, sad world
When a girl will break a boy just because she can

Don't you tell me to deny it
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins
I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true
And I just don't know where I can begin

Ooh
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Heaven, help me for the way I am
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
But I keep livin' this day like the next will never come

Oh, help me, but don't tell me to deny it
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'til I'm good enough for him
I've got a lot to lose and I'm bettin' high, so I'm beggin' you
Before it ends just tell me where to begin

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Let me know the way
Before there's hell to pay
Give me room to lay the law and let me go
I've got to make a play
To make my lover stay
So, what would an angel say?
The devil wants to know

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love",331
Fiona Apple,I Want You to Love Me,Fetch the Bolt Cutters,"I've waited many years
Every print I left upon the track
Has led me here
And next year, it'll be clear
This was only leading me to that
And by that time, I hope that

You love me
You love me

I move with the trees in the breeze
I know that time is elastic
And I know when I go
All my particles disband and disperse
And I'll be back in the pulse
And I know none of this will matter in the long run
But I know a sound is still a sound around no one
And while I'm in this body
I want somebody to want
And I want what I want and I want

You to love me
You

And I know that you do
In the dark, I know that you do
And I know that you know that you got
The potential to pick me up
And I want you to use it, blast the music
Bang it, bite it, bruise it
Whenever you want to begin, begin
We don't have to go back to where we've been
I am the woman who wants you to win
And I've been waiting, waiting for
You to love me
You
You
Ooh, ooh",207
Fiona Apple,Fetch the Bolt Cutters,Fetch the Bolt Cutters,"I've been thinking about when I was trying to be your friend
I thought it was then, but it wasn't, it wasn't genuine
I was just so furious, but I couldn't show you
'Cause I know you and I know what you can do
And I don't want a war with you, I won't afford it
You get sore, even when you win

And you maim when you're on offense
But you kill when you're on defense
And you've got them all convinced
That you're the means and the end
All the VIPs and PYTs and wannabes
Afraid of not being your friend

And I've always been too smart for that
But you know what? My heart was not
I took it like a kid, you see
The cool kids voted to get rid of me
I'm ashamed of what it did to me
What I let get done
It stole my fun, it stole my fun

Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters

He sings so nice, I guess he tries (I've been thinking about when I was trying to be your friend)
(I thought it was then, but it wasn't, it wasn't genuine)

Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters (I've been in here too long)
Whatever happens, whatever happens (Whatever happens)
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters

While I'd not yet found my bearings
Those it girls hit the ground
Comparing the way I was to the way she was
Sayin' I'm not stylish enough and I cry too much
And I listened because I hadn't found my own voice yet
So all I could hear was the noise that
People make when they don't know shit
But I didn't know that yet

I grew up in the shoes they told me I could fill
When they came around, I would stand real still
A girl can roll her eyes at me and kill
I got the idea I wasn't real
I thought being blacklisted would be grist for the mill
Until I realized I'm still here (I'm still here)
I grew up in the shoes they told me I could fill
Shoes that were not made for running up that hill
And I need to run up that hill, I need to run up that hill
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will

Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, whatever happens, whatever happens
Fetch the bolt cutters, I've been in here too long
Fetch the bolt cutters, whatever happens, whatever happens
Fetch the bolt cutters (I've been in here too long)
Whatever happens, whatever happens

Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters (I will, I will)
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Fetch the bolt cutters, fetch the bolt cutters
Whatever happens, whatever happens
Whatever happens, whatever happens
Fetch the bolt cutters (Whatever happens, whatever happens), fetch the bolt cutters",546
Fiona Apple,Shameika,Fetch the Bolt Cutters,"I used to walk down the streets
On my way to school
Grinding my teeth to a rhythm invisible
I used my feet to crush dead leaves like they had fallen from trees
Just for me, just to be crash cymbals

In class, I'd pass the time
Drawing a slash for every time
The second hand went by a group of five
Done twelve times was a minute

But Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential

I used to march down the windy, windy sidewalks
Slapping my leg with a riding crop
Thinking it made me come off so tough
I didn't smile, because a smile always seemed rehearsed
I wasn't afraid of the bullies, and that just made the bullies worse

In class, I'd pass the time
Drawing a slash for every time
The second hand went by a group of five
Done twelve times was a minute

But Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential

Hurricane Gloria in excelsis deo
That's my bird in my tree
My dog and my man and my music is my holy trinity
Hurricane Gloria in excelsis deo
That's my bird in my tree
My dog and my man and my music is my holy trinity

Tony told me he'd describe me as pissed off, funny, and warm
Sebastian said I'm a good man in a storm
Back then I didn't know what potential meant
And Shameika wasn't gentle and she wasn't my friend but
She got through to me and I'll never see her again
She got through to me and I'll never see her again
I'm pissed off, funny, and warm
I'm a good man in a storm
And when the fall is torrential, I'll recall

Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential

Tony told me he'd describe me as pissed off, funny, and warm
Sebastian said I'm a good man in a storm
Back then I didn't know what potential meant
But Shameika wasn't gentle and she wasn't my friend
But she got through to me and I'll never see her again
She got through to me and I'll never see her again
I'm pissed off, funny, and warm
I'm a good man in a storm
And when the fall is torrential, I'll recall

Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential
Shameika said I had potential

Fiona Apple,For Her,Fetch the Bolt Cutters,"Look at how feathered his cocks are
See how seamless his frocks are
Look at his paper-beating over that rockstar
Look at how long she walks and how far
Was she lost? Or
Maybe she was not for
Traveling in the stock car anymore
Maybe she spent her formative years
Dealing with his contentious fears
And endless jeers at her endless tears
Or maybe she just got tired of watching him

Sniff white off a starlet's breast
Treating his wife like less than a guest
Getting his girl to clean up his mess
Never showing weakness unless it's a ward's season
It's the season of the ward
And she's trying to cut the cord
She's tired of planting her knees on the cold, hard floor of facts
Trying to act like the other girl acts

And your strike may have been exact
But you know that you never really go to the mat
You tie everything all pretty in the second act
When you know that it didn't go exactly like that

You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat
Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
You arrive and drive by like a sauced up bat

Like you know you should know, but you don't know where it's at
Like you know you should know, but you don't know what you did
Like you know, you should know what happened when I came to bed
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know what you did

Well, good morning
Good morning
You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
(Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know
Like you know you should know, but you don't know)

You were so high
You were so high
You were so high",395
Fiona Apple,Valentine,The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do,"You didn't see my valentine
I sent it via pantomime
While you were watching someone else
I stared at you and cut myself
That's all I'll do cause I'm not free
A fugitive too dull to flee
I'm amorous but out of reach
A still life drawing of a peach

I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I've made my peace, I'm dead, I'm done
I watch you live to have my fun

I root for you, I love you
You you you you
I root for you, I love you
You, you, you, you

I made it to a dinner date
My teardrops seasoned every plate
I tried to dance but lost my nerve
I cramped up in the learning curve

I'm a tulip in a cup
I stand no chance of growing up
I'm resigned to sail on through
In the wake of tales of you

I root for you, I love you
You you you you
I root for you, I love you
You, you, you
I root for you, I love you
You you you, you you you you
I root for you, I love you
You, you, you",199
Fiona Apple,I Know,"When The Pawn Hits The Conflicts He Thinks Like A King What He Knows Throws The Blows When He Goes To The Fight And He’ll Win The Whole Thing ’Fore He Enters The Ring There’s No Body To Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold You","So be it, I'm your crowbar
If that's what I am so far
Until you get out of this mess
And I will pretend
That I don't know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know

And you can use my skin
To bury secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know

Baby
I can't help you out
While she is still around

So for the time being, I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don't make sense all the time
Give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtain
I'll wait by the backstage door

While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for an encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
It's okay, don't need to say it",199
Fiona Apple,Every Single Night,The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do,"Every single night, I endure the flight
Of little wings of white-flamed butterflies in my brain
These ideas of mine percolate the mind
Trickle down the spine, swarm the belly, swellin' to a blaze

That's where the pain comes in like a second skeleton
Tryin' to fit beneath the skin, I can't fit the feelings in, oh

Every single night's alight with my brain, brain

I say to her, why'd I say it to her?
What does she think of me? That I'm not what I ought to be
That I'm what I try not to be, it's got to be somebody else's fault
I can't get caught

If what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
Then brother get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open
The rib is the shell, and a heart is the yolk
And I just made a meal for us both to choke on

Every single night's a fight with my brain, brain

I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything

So now I'm gonna try to be still now
Gonna renounce the mill a little while
And if we had a double-king-sized bed
We could move in it, and I'd soon forget

That what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
And maybe I'd relax, let my breast just bust open
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me
And that's why the devil just can't get around me

Every single night's alright, every single night's a fight
And every single fight's alright with my brain, brain

I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything
I just wanna feel everything",293
