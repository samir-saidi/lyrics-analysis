Michael Jackson,Billie Jean,The Ultimate Fan Extras Collection,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene, uh
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one, uh
Who will dance on the floor in the round?

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do,"" uh
""And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh, oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh, oh), hey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
Uh, she says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee; no, no)
(Hee-hee-hee, woo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee, uh, uh)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice (Don't think twice)
Do think twice (A-hoo)
She told my baby we danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do,"" uh
""And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey

Billie Jean is not my lover (Woo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son, uh
No-no-no, uh, no-no-no, no-no-no (Woo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, no)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee-hee)
(Ah-hee-hee-hee)

Hee, hoo
(Chicka-boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom)

She says I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no, woo, uh)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no (No-no-no, ah), no-no-no-no (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (No, baby)
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no; woo, uh)

She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breakin' my heart, babe)
She says I am the one
Yeah, yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl)
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; she's not at the scene)

Michael Jackson,Heal the World,The Indispensable Collection,"Think about, um, the generations, and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and children's children so that they, they, they s— they know it's a better world for them. Think they can make it a better place

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?

Michael Jackson,Rock With You,The Ultimate Fan Extras Collection,"Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

When you feel that heat
And we gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We gon' rock the night away

And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

I wanna rock (All night)
With you, girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you, girl (Yeah)

Every time you see, hahaha

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Back in the fall? (I'll make you remember)
We'd be together (I'll make you remember)
All day long (I know you remember)
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Us holding hands? (I'll make you remember)
In each other's eyes (I'll make you remember)
We'd stare (I know), tell me

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, ""I love you so,"" ""I'll never let you go""

Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Back in the spring? (I know you remember)
Every morning (I'll make you remember)
The birds would sing (I know you remember)
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Those special times? (I know you remember)
They'll just go on and on (I'll make you remember)
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we did
Now, baby

Michael Jackson,You Are Not Alone,The Indispensable Collection,"Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself ""How did love slip away?""
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day, I sit and ask myself ""How did love slip away?""
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh-oh)

('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
('Lone, 'lone) You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
('Lone, 'lone) If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
('Lone, 'lone) Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh
('Lone, 'lone) Together, together
('Lone, 'lone) Can't stop being alone
Can't stop being alone
You believe in me",406
