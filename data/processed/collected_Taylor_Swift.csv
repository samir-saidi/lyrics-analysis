Taylor Swift,All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault],Red (Taylor’s Version),"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it",968
Taylor Swift,Wood,The Life of a Showgirl (Track by Track Version),"Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not, he loves me not
Penny's unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack and the black cat laughed

And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine (Ah)
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood

(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood

Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my еyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was thе key that opened my thighs

Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet, mm
To know a hard rock is on the way

And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
The curse on me was broken by your magic wand (Ah)
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood), I ain't gotta knock on wood

(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood

Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my thighs
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He ah-matized me and opened my eyes

His love was the key that opened my thighs",311
Taylor Swift,Fortnight,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY (Target Exclusive),"I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an 
endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the 
effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

And for a fortnight there, 
we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, 
we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you 
touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida,
 
buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you",319
Taylor Swift,The Fate of Ophelia,The Life of a Showgirl (Track by Track Version),"I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me (Me), myself (Myself), and I (I)
Right before you lit my sky up

All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophеlia)

Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), thе sea (Sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

The eldest daughter of a nobleman
Ophelia lived in fantasy
But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
The venom stole her sanity

And if you'd never come for me (Come for me)
I might've lingered in purgatory
You wrap around me like a chain (A chain), a crown (A crown), a vine (A vine)
Pulling me into the fire

All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)

Taylor Swift,cardigan,folklore: the long pond studio sessions (from the Disney+ special) [deluxe edition],"Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite",336
Taylor Swift,loml,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY (Target Exclusive),"Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life",361

So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)

I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe

Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?""
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone

I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free

For so long, London
Stitches undone
Two graves, one gun
I'll find someone

And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there

So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?

You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
And I'm just getting color back into my face
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run)
A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun)

Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

And who's gonna hold you like me?

Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

With every guitar string scar on my hand

Taylor Swift,But Daddy I Love Him,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY (Target Exclusive),"I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over

Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy

If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

Taylor Swift,Down Bad,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY (Target Exclusive),"Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

For a moment, I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

For a moment, I was heavenstruck

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him",472
Taylor Swift,Father Figure,The Life of a Showgirl (Track by Track Version),"When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
""You remind me of a younger me,"" I saw potential

I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve

Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family

I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, ""They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign""
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé

I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets

Leave it with me, I protect the family

I saw a change in you  (I saw a change, saw a change in you)
My dear boy
They don't make loyalty like they used to (Not like they used to)
Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
On foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions
That to fulfill your dreams
You had to get rid of me
I protect the family

I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor
You made a deal with this devil, turns out my dick's bigger
You want a fight? You found it, I got the place surrounded
You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning
Whose portrait's on the mantel? Who covered up your scandals?
Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled
I was your father figure, you pulled the wrong trigger
This empire belongs to me

Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me

""You know, you remind me of a younger me""
I saw potential",355
Taylor Swift,the 1,folklore: the long pond studio sessions (from the Disney+ special) [deluxe edition],"I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Taylor Swift,Is It Over Now? (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault],1989 (Taylor’s Version) (Tangerine Edition),"(
Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

(
Is it? Is it? Is it?
)

Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

Uh-huh

And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Taylor Swift,Cruel Summer,Lover (Target Exclusive/Japanese Edition),"(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven

Taylor Swift,thanK you aIMee,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY (Target Exclusive),"When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you

And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause

All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

Thank you, Aimee
Thank you, Aimee",410
Taylor Swift,august,folklore: the long pond studio sessions (from the Disney+ special) [deluxe edition],"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""

Taylor Swift,The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY (Target Exclusive),"Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man

And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing

And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived",311
