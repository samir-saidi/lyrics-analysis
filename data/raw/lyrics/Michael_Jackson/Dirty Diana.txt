(Oh, no)
(Oh, no, no)

You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time, you won't seduce me

She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back", she trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
(Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no)

She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She's saying "That's okay, hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star"

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Diana, Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
Come on!

No, no, oh-, stop this

She said "I have to go home, 'cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that, I ran to the phone saying, "Baby, I'm alright"
I said "But unlock the door, 'cause I forgot the key"
She said "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me"

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

Come on! (Dirty Diana, no)
