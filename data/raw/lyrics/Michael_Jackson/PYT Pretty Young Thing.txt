You know you, you make me feel so good inside
I've always wanted a girl just like you
Such a P.Y.T., pretty young thing, ooh

Where did you come from, lady?
And ooh, won't you take me there?
Right away, won't you, baby?
Tenderoni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar, fly with me

Don't you know now is the perfect time?
We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight, ease the lovin' pain
Let me take you to the max

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You'll need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, girl, ooh-oh
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You'll need some lovin' (
T.L.C.
)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there

(Anywhere you wanna go) Yes, I will, ooh

Nothin' can stop this burnin' desire to be with you
Gotta get to you, baby
Won't you come? It's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free

Don't you know now is the perfect time?
We can dim the lights just to make it right
In the night, hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You'll need some loving (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, yes, I will, yes, I
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You'll need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Yes, I will, hee-eeh

Pretty young thing, uh!
You make me sing, ha, ha, ha
Pretty young thing, uh!
You make me sing, ha, ha, ha
Pretty young things, repeat after me
Sing, "Na, na, na" (
Na, na, na

"Na, na-na, na" (

Sing, "Na, na, na" (

Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Take you there, take you there
