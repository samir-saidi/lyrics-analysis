All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage!
(Okay, alright, alright, alright)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Skinhead, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody, dog food
Bang-bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody, do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black-or-white me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

And tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am a victim of police brutality now (Hee)
I'm tired of bein' a victim of hate
You're rapin' me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I don't like havin' to fulfill this prophecy
Set me free

Skinhead, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation
Everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news
Everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail
Throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

And tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty now (Hee)
I'm tired of bein' a victim of shame
You're throwin' me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came

You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skinhead, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us


Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be
No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Skinhead, dead head
Everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation (Hoo-hoo)
Everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news (Hoo-hoo)
Everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me
Don't you wrong-or-right me (Deep in the fire)

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
We're deep in the fire (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
I'm there to remind you (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us (Hee)
Don't you sit back and watch the beatin'
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us (Hee-hee-hee)
Hee-hee, hoo-hoo
