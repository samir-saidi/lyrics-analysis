Somethin' in the way you love me won't let me be
I don't want to be your prisoner, so baby, won't you set me free?
Stop playin' with my heart, finish what you start
When you make my love come down
If you want me, let me know
Baby, let it show
Honey, don't you fool around

Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline
Feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)
Keep on pushin' me, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline

Somethin' in your eyes is makin' such a fool of me
When you hold me in your arms, you love me 'til I just can't see
But then you let me down
When I look around
Baby, you just can't be found
Stop drivin' me away, I just wanna stay
There's somethin' I just got to say

Just try to understand (Understand)
I've given all I can
'Cause you got the best of me

Borderline
Feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline
Borderline
Feels like I'm goin' to lose my mind
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)
Keep on pushin' me, baby
Don't you know you drive me crazy?
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline
Look what your love has done to me
Come on, baby, set me free
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline
(Borderline)
You cause me so much pain
I think I'm goin' insane
What does it take to make you see?
You just keep on pushin' my love
Over the borderline

Keep pushin' me
Keep pushin' me
Keep pushin' my love
(Keep on pushin' my love)
Come on, baby
Come on, darlin', yeah
(Over the borderline, borderline)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
You just keep on pushin' my love
