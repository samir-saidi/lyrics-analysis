And you can dance
For inspiration
Come on
I'm waiting

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

Music can be such a revelation
Dancin' around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feelin' never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancin' can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancin' here all by myself
Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be?

Gonna get to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me every day
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise
I see the fire burnin' in your eyes

Only when I'm dancin' can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancin' here all by myself
Tonight, I wanna dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove your love to me, yeah
Get up on your feet, yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be? (Yeah)

Live out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body, and move in time
Now I know you're mine (You've got to)

Get into the groove
Boy, you've got to prove your love to me
