'Cause I'm a bad bitch

We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinkin' and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissin' anybody that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight (Blow up this shit tonight)
Put me under the flashin' light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight (Gonna blow up)


We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na-na-na-na-na
We go hard or we go home
We gon' do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch, I'm Madonna

Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna
Bitch, bitch I'm Madonna

We're jumpin' in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I poured a beer into my shoe and got my freak on
The neighbor's pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If they show up then we are gonna give a good show

I just wanna go out tonight
Put me under the flashin' light
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Let me blow up this house tonight (Gon' blow up)

I run shit, I don't fall back 'cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got 'em awestruck, it's not a toss-up, I'm the winner
Beep-b-b-beep-beep, bitch move, 'fore I bang-bang with that Uzi
That's Miu Miu on my shoes, ain't got a thing left for me to prove (Uh)
It's that bottle service all night, it's that pop and urban just right
It's that "go hard or go home" zone, bitch
