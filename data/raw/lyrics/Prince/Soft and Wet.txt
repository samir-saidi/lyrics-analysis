Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I want to lose in you, baby, can you stand the pain?
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooh, baby!

(Hey, lover)
All I want to see is the love in your eyes
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
(Hey, lover)
All I wanna feel is a burning flame
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me, girl

If this is lust, then I must confess I feel it every day
If this is wrong, then I long to be as far from right as I may

Soft and wet
Soft and wet


Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death
Ooh, wee, baby, you leave me without breath
Oh, baby!
Ooh, yeah

(Hey, lover)
You're just as soft as a lion tamed
You're just as wet as the evening rain
(Hey, lover)
And I really dig it when you call my name
Your love is driving me, you're driving me insane
Crazy, baby, oh, girl
Crazy about your love!

Soft and wet (You know)
You are soft and wet (Oh, sugar)
Your love is soft and wet
Ooh, soft and wet
Ooh, oh
