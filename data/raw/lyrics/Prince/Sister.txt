I was only sixteen, but I guess that's no excuse
My sister was thirty-two, lovely and loose
She don't wear no underwear
She said it only gets in her hair
And it's got a funny way of stopping the juice
My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my – uh, sexuality
Showed me where it's supposed to go
A blow job doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said to be

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

I was only sixteen and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted to turn me out
She took a whip to me until I'd shout
"Oh, motherfucker, sister, motherfucker
Can't you understand?"

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

I know what you want me to do
Put me on the street and make me blue
Oh, sister
Ooh-hoo, sister
Ooh-oo-ooh!
