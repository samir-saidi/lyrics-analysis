Here we are, folks
The dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl
In the World Series of love
Tell me... have you got the look?

You walked in, I woke up
I’ve never seen a pretty girl look so tough – baby!
You got that look, ah
Color you peach and black
Color me taken aback
Crucial, I think I want ya

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

Look here...

You got the look (You got the look)
You must've took (
You must've took
)
A whole hour just to make-up your face – baby!
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected
(Everybody's inspected)
But you are a natural beauty, unaffected (
Unaffected
)
Did I say an hour? My face is red – I stand corrected
(
I stand corrected
)

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

There's no two who'd do...
Well, here we are
Ladies and gentlemen
The dream we all dream of (Oh, please!)
Boy versus girl
In the World Series of love
Slammin'!

You walked in (I walked in)
I woke up (You woke up)
I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough, baby (Baby!)
You got that look (You got that look)
Yes, you do (Yes, you do)
Color you peach and black
Color me taken aback (Baby!)
Crucial – I think I want ya

You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If your love is good, let's get to rammin'
Now – you got the look, you got the look

Uh-huh... here we are, folks!
The dream we all dream of!
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
You got the look
