It's been seven hours and thirteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said, "Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do"
But he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing


All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with me, baby, was some kind of hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
I said nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
