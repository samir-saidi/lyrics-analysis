Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright

As the years, they pass us by (The years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (Each other's eyes)

Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love (Your love, your love, baby)
It would take an eternity to break us

And my love is your love (My love is your love)
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I should die this very day (Very, very day)
Don't cry (Don't cry), 'cause on Earth, we wasn't meant to stay
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
And no matter what people say (Really don't matter)
Clap your hands, y'all, it's alright
I'll be waiting for you after Judgement Day
