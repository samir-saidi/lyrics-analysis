You can't hear me
You can't hear me
You can't hear what I'm saying
You can't hear what I'm saying to you

You watch the clock move the slow hand
I should have been home hours ago
But I'm not here
But I'm not here

You can't hear me
You can't hear me
You can't feel me
Here in the room with you now
You can't hear what I'm saying
You don't hear what I'm saying to you

Can't let you know what's been happening
There's a ghost in our home just watching you without me
But I'm not here
But I'm not here
But I'm not here

You don't hear me
You don't hear me

Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
Don't ignore, don't ignore me
Let me in and don't be long
We, we see
We see, we, we see, we, we see
We see, we, we see, we, we see
We, we see

You didn't hear me come in
Help me, baby, help me, baby, talk to me
Listen to me, baby
Listen to me, listen to me, talk to me, oh, please, listen
You can't hear me
Listen, baby, listen to me, baby, help me, help me, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, please, baby, talk to me
You won't hear me leaving
