The light
Begin to bleed
Begin to breathe
Begin to speak
Do you know what?
I love you better now

I am falling
Like a stone
Like a storm
Being born again
Into the sweet morning fog

Do you know what?
I love you better now

I'm falling
And I'd love to hold you now
I'll kiss the ground
I'll tell my mother
I'll tell my father
I'll tell my loved ones
I'll tell my brothers
How much I love them
