I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you (Ah)

We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this, swerve, surfin' all in this good-good (Ha-ha-ha)

We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', "How the hell did this shit happen?", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
[Chorus: Beyoncé & 
JAY-Z
]
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love (
I'm nice right now, hold up
)

That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae," said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae"
I'm nice
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight
We sex again in the mornin'
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in
[Chorus: Beyoncé, 
Beyoncé & JAY-Z
]
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin' watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love
