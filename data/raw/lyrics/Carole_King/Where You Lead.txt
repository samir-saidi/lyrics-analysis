Loving you the way I do
I only wanna be with you
And I would go to the ends of the earth
'Cause darling, to me that's what you're worth

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

If you're out on the road
Feeling lonely, and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there on the next train

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead

I always wanted a real home
With flowers on the window sill
But if you want to live in New York City
Honey, you know I will (Yes I will, yes I will)
I never thought I could get satisfaction
From just one man
But if anyone can keep me happy
You're the one who can

Where you lead, I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow oh, oh
Where you lead, I will follow
Any, anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow where you lead
Oh baby
Ooh (Ooh)

I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh baby, yeah, I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Ooh sugar, uh huh, I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Oh baby, yeah, I'm gonna follow where you lead
(I'm gonna follow where you lead)
Ooh yeah, I'm gonna follow where you lead
