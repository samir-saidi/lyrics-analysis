Loving you the way I do
I know we're gonna make it through
And I will go
To the ends of the earth
'Cause darling, to me that's what you're worth

Where you lead
I will follow
Anywhere that you tell me to
If you need, if you need me to be with you
I will follow
Where you lead

If you're out on the road
Feelin' lonely and so cold
All you have to do is call my name
And I'll be there
On the next train

Where you lead
I will follow anywhere
That you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow
Where you lead

I always wanted a real home
With flowers on the windowsill
But if you wanna live in New York City
Honey you know I will
You never know how it's all gonna turn out
But that's ok
Just as long
As we're together
We can find a way

Where you lead
I will follow, anywhere
That you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow -
Oh, oh, oh!
Where you lead
I will follow, anywhere
That you tell me to
If you need, you need me to be with you
I will follow
Where you lead

Oh baby, yeah
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
I'm gonna follow where you lead
