I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around

Ooh, baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darlin', I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down
I feel my heart start to tremblin'
Whenever you're around


Ooh, darlin', when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
Are somethin' I just can't tame
I've just got to have you, baby
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down

I just a-lose control
Down to my very soul
I get a-hot and cold
All over, all over, all over, all over

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumblin' down, a-tumblin' down

A-tumblin' down
A-tumblin' down
A-tumblin' down
Tumblin' down
