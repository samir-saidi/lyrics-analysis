I know I may be young, but I've got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always sayin', "Little girl, don't step into the club"
Well, I'm just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing's what I love, yeah (Now watch me)

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it (Do you like it?), get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, uh
(This feels good)

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talkin', feel like dancin' when I see this guy
What's practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancin' there

I'm a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny it, I'm not tryna hide it
Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance up on me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age (Let's go)

Like that
You like it?
Yeah
Now watch me

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it (Do you like it?), get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, uh
(This feels good)

I really wanna dance tonight with you (I just can't help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to (I just gotta let myself go)
I really wanna dance tonight with you (I wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to (Uh, uh, uh)

Baby, don't you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh, baby, don't you wanna dance up on me? (Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age
I'm a slave for you (Like that)
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you (It just feels right, it just feels good)
I won't deny it, I'm not tryna hide it, baby

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, uh
(Just move with me)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, woah
Get it, get it, get it, get it, uh

I'm a slave for you (Here we go now)
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I'm a slave for you (Here we go)
I won't deny it, I'm not tryna hide it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Like that
