Friday
I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody
This feeling, I wanna go with it, 'cause there's no way
We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowin' up to the ceiling, we burnin' bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah (Yeah), Eazy

I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star (Star)
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It's really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes comin'
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speakin' my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go (Go)
Like Penelope in 
Blow
 (Blow)
Well aware that stealin' you is a felony, yeah, I know
That's why they keep on tellin' me to let go, yeah (Go)

But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah (Go)
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

And make me ooh (Move), ooh, ooh (Yeah), ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, you make me ooh
