'Til the world ends
Remix

I, chimpanzees is hatin', but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career, but somebody lied
I ain't talkin' poultry when I say this chicken's fried
Anyway, Britney
Why they so jealous that you teamed up with me?
Tell 'em they my son, yup, gyal 'em a mi pickney
Anyway, brembedell
What's that? I don’t know, but Femme Fatale
Sniff, sniff, cries
I done slayed your whole entire **** life
Oh, you got some Epsom salt?
I done balled all day, you ain't touched the court
What? What, you tired? You need a break?
You was hot when? Ricki Lake

I notice that you got it, you notice that I want it
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
If you want this good ish, th-th-th-this is the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

It's Britney, bitch
I'm Nicki Minaj and that's Kesha

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waitin' for?

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch, dancin' in the dark
You notice what I'm wearin', I'm noticin' you starin'
You know that I can take it to the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list, next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waitin' for?

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

See the sunlight, we ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
Keep on d-d-dancin' 'til the world ends
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

See the sunlight, we ain't stoppin'
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancin' 'til the world ends
