All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise (It's Iggy-Iggs)
We're just so pretty
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty

Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia around to L.A.​​​​​​
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable
(
Some things don't change
)

The girls roll up (
Windows roll down
)
Eyes on us (Jaws on the ground)
Watch them go (Wow, it's just so funny)
Like bees to the honey

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty

Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "Hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(
Some things don't change
)

The girls roll up (
Windows roll down
)
Eyes on us (Jaws on the ground)
Watch them go (It's just so funny)
Like bees to the honey

All around the world, pretty girls (Uh-huh)
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want (Oh yeah)
We're just so pretty (Pretty)

Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance (
Ooh
)
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (Ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time, Iggs

What's up, Britney? (Uh-huh)

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty (Pretty)
All around the world, pretty girls (Pretty girls)
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty
