Hey hey hey, the end is near
On a good day, you can see the end from here
But I won't turn back now, though the way is clear
I will stay for the remainder

I saw a life and I called it mine
I saw it drawn so sweet and fine
And I had begun to fill in all the lines
Right down to what we'd name her

Our nature does not change by will
In the winter, 'round the ruined mill
The creek is lying, flat and still
It is water, though it's frozen

So 'cross the years and miles, and through
On a good day, you can feel my love for you
Will you leave me be so that we can stay true
To the path that you have chosen?
