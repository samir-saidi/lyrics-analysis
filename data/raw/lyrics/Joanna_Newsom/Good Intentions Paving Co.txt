Twenty miles left to the show
Hello, my old country, hello
Stars are just beginning to appear
And I have never, in my life, before been here
And it's my heart, not me, who cannot drive
At which conclusion you arrived
Watching me sit here, bolt upright and cry
For no good reason at the Eastering sky

And the tilt of this strange nation
And the will to remain for the duration
Waving the flag, feeling it drag
Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby
Like I'm in a fistfight with the fog, baby
Step, ball-change, and a-pirouette!
And I regret, I regret

How I said to you, "Honey, just open your heart,"
When I've got trouble even opening a honey jar
And that, right there, is where we are

And I've been 'fessin' double-fast
Addressing questions nobody asked
I'll get this joy off of my chest at last
And I will love you 'til the noise has long since passed
And I did not mean to shout, just drive
Just get us out, dead or alive
The road's too long to mention— Lord, it's something to see!
Laid down by the Good Intentions Paving Company

All the way to the thing we've been playing at, darling
I can see that you're wearing your staying-hat, darling
For the time being, all is well
Won't you love me a spell?
This is blindness beyond all conceiving
While, behind us, the road is leaving
And leaving, and falling back
Like a rope gone slack

And I saw straightaway that the lay was steep
But I fell for you, honey, easy as falling asleep
And that, right there, is the course I keep

And no amount of talking is going to soften the fall
But, like after the rain, step out of the overhang, that's all
It had a nice ring to it when the old opry house rang
So, with a solemn auld lang 
syne, sealed, delivered, I sang
And there is hesitation and it always remains
Concerning you, me, and the rest of the gang
And in our quiet hour, I feel I see everything
And am in love with the hook upon which everyone hangs.
And I know you meant to show the extent
To which you gave a goddang
You ranged real hot and real cold, but I'm sold
I am home on that range
And I do hate to fold
Right here, at the top of my game
When I've been trying with my whole heart and soul
To stay right here, in the right lane
But it can make you feel over, and old
(Lord, you know it's a shame)
When I only want for you to pull over and hold me
'Til I can't remember my own name
